"Booked last minute, no regrets","I just want to write a quick review. I had to book this last minute (I found it on AirBnB) and I'm really pleased. It's in what used to be an old hotel.

Green tortoise is my favourite place to stay in San Francisco!,"I've been here three times.  Once in 2014, once in 2015, and once more in 2018.  Good times were had each time.

Excellent funky space - with an awesome dining/ entertainment room.,"A basic room, but clean, enough space & not far from the nearest showers/ bathrooms.

Your spot in San Francisco you don't want to leave,"This was really nice hostel: the athmosphere was nice, there are organized events everyday, three times a week they host a delicious vegetarian dinner & give away free snacks. Best things there are still the musical instruments to use and play with your friends or people who youâ€¦"
Great Hostel,"This is the second time we have stayed here, and I would stay again. We loved the friendly atmosphere here and the evenings where you could volunteer to help in the kitchen to cook for everyone in the hostel.

Pricey and very small ,"The rooms in the hostel are very small and it is better when you donâ€˜t bring a lot of luggage to store with you.

Everything a hostel should be,"Green Tortoise was great. Everything a hostel should be. Hotel taxes, etc. make San Francisco not the cheapest city for hostels.

Looking to save money....and have fun,"The green tortoise was a great choice by my friend. There are a few hostels in SF but this one was perfect.

Pleasantly Surprised!,"Never staying in a hostel before, I had my doubts.  I envisioned the shared bathrooms to have several toilets and showers and no privacy.  I expected (at least) slightly dirty conditions and run-down rooms.  Not!  The restrooms are private, each having its own toilet, sink andâ€¦"
Location could be better.,"I don't know why everyone is saying the location is that great, because it isn't.

Private rooms - clean but so noisy!,"After a great stay in a dorm in 2012, we returned and tried out the private rooms which are in a separate building a couple of blocks away.

Great hostel!!!,"Excellent location! There's a tram stop just down the street, and within easy walking distance to good cheap restaurants. We got a private twin room, and it was just big enough for 2. Only tiny drawback was the bed. Super hard, like sleeping on a wooden board. But that was it.â€¦"

Affordable and Convenient Location,I've never been to a hostel prior to Green Tortoise so this was an awesome experience.

Overpriced disappointment,"I chose this hostel based on the good reviews on tripadvisor. However, only the location was excellent, but the (private) room was small, dark and it lacked storage space.

Great Hostel!,"We picked Green Tortoise based on the reviews here (which weren't wrong) and the fact that this hostel seems to be one of the cheapest in San Fran (which isn't cheap at all).  It's in a convenient area, close to the waterfront and easy enough to walk to Union Square too. Lots ofâ€¦"
Noisy dance clubs but near Chinatown.,Many dance clubs nearby and homeless loitering around. Next to Chinatown. Definitely not for family stay or preference for quiet nights.

Nice hostel,"The Green Tortoise is a nice hostel in San Fran located near the red light district, despite that it isn't seedy or low brow. Feels perfectly safe.  The triple room was adequate. Nothing special, but clean and comfortable. Didn't have any issues.   Breakfast is serve yourself.â€¦"

"Good place, Great breakfast","I stayed here a couple of days during my road trip. Place was nice and the staff friendly. Although the location is good, the rooms are quite small. There is events almost all evening to meet people. Worth to stay if you want to have a good time and meet people."
DEFINITELY WORTH A VISIT,The Green Tortoise was recommended to us by a friend during our stay at another hostel in San Fran.

Cool Place- but not for the faint of heart,"Went here years ago, not bad.  Cheap inexpensive but very cool :) Enjoyed it very much.  A little too much noise but overall not bad.  The staff was helpful and the location is near strip clubs which is kinda weird and sketchy."
You must stay here!,"This is probably my favourite hostel ever!  First it has great facilities: big kitchen / dining room, free wi fi, lots of storage space in the rooms etc etc.  The location is also great. There are a few strip clubs around but really nothing to worry about.  Pretty muchâ€¦"
Hostel Extraordinnaire,"Not being a regular hostel-dweller, I was quite uncertain as to what to expect from the Green Tortoise, other than the fact that we would probably feel far too old to be wandering its corridors.

Best Hostel in San Fran,"After backpacking around western America in 2011. I can honestly say this was the best hostel we stayed at.

not as good as everyone says,It's quite expensive compared to some other budget accomodation in SFO and to be honest i didn't think it was worth the extra money.

Fun and good value,"The rooms are small, but the beds are comfortable and clean.  It wasn't bad not having the bathroom attached to the room, since there are so many bathrooms close to any room.

Go for a adventure!,Not the best location and not the cleanest of places. One of the most ideal places to meet foreign travelers with more personality than money. Gateway to a different way of travel. Start with a small trip to see if you can handle the bus. Live for the love of life!
Good Hostel,"Over the past year we have stayed in A LOT of hostels in A LOT of different places and this has to be one of the best. It has it's faults but then again I think every hostel does - not enough bathrooms for the number of guests, top bunks are quite high and a little bit annoyingâ€¦"
Central Location...cheap accommodation,I was here for 2 nights and this hostel is clean. Good breakfast in the morning. Good position in downtown San Francisco. Buy earplugs because it's very busy even during the night
"Central location, kinda expensive","Great location, helpful staff, funky well maintained old style building, good common area, breakfast and activities.

Friendly staff and good service,"It was Thanksgiving while i arrived there with my friends and from the first moment we got in, we were welcomed very warmly.

Don't come here unless you are a backpacker!,This was a nice hostel it just wasn't for us. Most people staying here are long term travellers and although it was clean on the surface there was little things which ruined our stay.

"They go above and beyond for their guests, they really do","I was booked in for burning man. I got sick on the way over, pnemonia! Needless to say my tour fell apart.

It's on a big hill - but then everywhere is!,"Green Tortoise hostel is really friendly and welcoming and well run.

Check out time was a bit manic, butâ€¦"
"Awesome hostel, but watch your back","This hostel is pretty good, as they say, one of the best.  Unfortunately  that means they get HEAPS of people in, and not all of them as friendly as they seem on the surface.

great value,Staying at Green Tortoise was a great choice. The rooms are clean and the mattress and pillows are comfy. The restrooms are clean and the showers are great. The free breakfast is pretty good for a hostel. They also offer free dinner 3 times per week and free wifi connection. Ifâ€¦
The Private room is amazing,"The hostel overall is really good. It has free wi-fi and computers that you can use 24/7.

Perfect for a short stay on a budget,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and found it perfect for our needs. We wanted a relatively clean private room to use as a base while in SF.

"Exciting fun lobby, Super restful peaceful rooms - wicked awesome location!","I always wanted to see the inside of the Green Tortoise Hotel and I finally got to visit at the end of July.

"Green Tortoise Hostel in SF is well reviewed, and deserves their great rating","We spent two weeks there and have no complaints. Yes, itâ€™s a hostel, so if youâ€™re into high-end electronics or designer furniture, this is not the place for you.

"Fun please, clean, interesting location","First up I was unsure about the location having read other reviews about it being in the Red Light District however not once did I feel unsafe or harrassed - on the contrary there were bouncers on every corner. Also, it is right around the corner from Chinatown and Little Italyâ€¦"
Great location and facilities,"This hostel is a great place to stay in San Francisco, They do free evening meals 3 times a week (always vegetarian), free breakfast everyday.

Setting an example for what hostels should be.,"Off of Broadway Ave. in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood lies good testament to the act of hostelling, The Green Tortoise. This is no name unknown to the frugal traveler. The Green Tortoise started as a bus that started taking people across country in green buses to seeâ€¦"
Meet people or sleep?,Green tortoise is not a place I'd pick to sleep good. I stayed there to meet people and that I did.

"Mediocre, at best, Illegal, at worst.","This place is pretty average fare for a hostel. The staff describe it as a 'party hostel' which is pretty accurate. If your looking for a place with small rooms, shared showers, questionable cleanliness, and easy access to pot, this is the place to go. If your looking forâ€¦"
GREAT Hostel. I loved it!,"This is the best hostel I've stayed so far. It is clean, with lots of computer terminals to use, and its easy to find one - internet is free.

Everything a hostel should be and more!,"The Green Tortoise might look a bit rough around the edges on first arrival but this hostel ticks every box if you are a backpacker looking to meet other people, hit all the cool spots of San Fran, save cash and take great tours.

Made my trip - perfect base in San Fran and hostel was a lot of fun,"Ok, so if you are looking for somewhere quiet, in the nicest area downtown and like to spend evenings quietly reading or whatever, the Green Tortoise may not be for you.

"Fun, Warm, Messy, Homely Place to Stay in San Francisco","Our stay at Green Tortoise from 7th Aug for 2 nights was very memorable. We met a fellow singaporean there by an incredible stroke of luck.

Amazing hostel that goes out of their way to make your trip the best it can be!,"We stayed at this hostel for a week and loved every minute of it.

There is a huge ballroom where lots of theâ€¦"
Located in Red Light District & Rowdy Hostel,"This hostel is unbelivable, It's located in the red light district with all the drunkards & prostitues around the area.

Check your room before you pay,"Well. To be fair, the hostels location is superb. Right next to North Beach(next to all the strip clubs, but hey). The facilities are okay, the kitchen could be bigger but it is well looked after and they throw on a free breakfast everyday and a free dinner three days a week.â€¦"
Better than I thought it would be,I found this hostel on tripadvisor.  My husband and I are not rich and wanted to visit San Francisco.  So hotels out there we found were in the range of $250 to $200 a night.  And Oracle conference was going on and there weren't any hotel rooms available anyway. So we decided toâ€¦
Didn't think it was bad,"My boyfriend and I stayed at a private room for 2 nights at the Tortoise.  After reading some bad reviews, I was quite nervous to see what I would find out.

Better than I expected!,"There are a lot of mixed reviews about this hostel, but out of the three hostels in San Francisco that I stayed in, the Green Tortoise was the most enjoyable overall with the friendliest, most sociable travellers.

"Was OK, nothing special","This hostel was OK, not the best but not the worst i've stayed in.

Must be better in SF,"We stayed here for 5 night in September.

Great relaxed vibe. Social Hostel,"If you're looking for a hostel with a bit of character and a relaxed friendly vibe then this is the hostel for you.

A good place to stay in San Fran,"Near Little Italy and Chinatown (both lovely neighbourhoods!), surrounded by strip clubs (the unionized, worker owned Lusty Lady is not to be missed if you're into ""that kind of thing""), and a stone's throw from the City Lights Bookstore, this typical backpackers hostel isâ€¦"

Great Location,"First impressions of this hostel weren't great. It wasn't the cleanest and seemed fairly grubby. But as I later learned most of the best hostels are like this around the world. Only my second stop on my world trip with my friends, we picked this place cos of the great reviews. â€¦"
Don't stay here ever.,"We booked this hostel after staying in Green tortoise in Seattle and finding the hostel just great.
