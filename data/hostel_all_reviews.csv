,Everything a hostel should be,"Green Tortoise was great. Everything a hostel should be. Hotel taxes, etc. make San Francisco not the cheapest city for hostels.

,Fun and good value,"The rooms are small, but the beds are comfortable and clean.  It wasn't bad not having the bathroom attached to the room, since there are so many bathrooms close to any room.

,Perfect for a short stay on a budget,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and found it perfect for our needs. We wanted a relatively clean private room to use as a base while in SF.

,"Exciting fun lobby, Super restful peaceful rooms - wicked awesome location!","I always wanted to see the inside of the Green Tortoise Hotel and I finally got to visit at the end of July.  The hotel had a lot more than I expected including free breakfast, wifi, and 3 dinners a week for free!  Oh yeah, there was a hot sauna as well that I had all to myself.…"
,"Green Tortoise Hostel in SF is well reviewed, and deserves their great rating","We spent two weeks there and have no complaints. Yes, it’s a hostel, so if you’re into high-end electronics or designer furniture, this is not the place for you. BUT--I was pleasantly surprised to receive a consistently excellent level of service. When we approached employees…"
,Great,Great location and price! Fun garanteed!! Especially in the Pub Crawl!!!
1,Great Value,"I stayed in this hostel for 2 nights and found it to be a great value. The location was excellent as it is close to many of the tourist attractions in the North Beach area.  A basic breakfast is even included with the room rate; bagels, juice, eggs etc. I was initially concerned…"

,"Fun please, clean, interesting location","First up I was unsure about the location having read other reviews about it being in the Red Light District however not once did I feel unsafe or harrassed - on the contrary there were bouncers on every corner. Also, it is right around the corner from Chinatown and Little Italy…"
,Great location and facilities,"This hostel is a great place to stay in San Francisco, They do free evening meals 3 times a week (always vegetarian), free breakfast everyday.  We stayed in a private room here for 4 days and it was a sweet cosy clean little room.  Value for money this a great place to stay. …"
1,"Dirty inside, strippers and homeless outside","Cheap, good service - but horrible rooms, small with communal dirty showers and toilets. The place has fitly facilities. Only good thing is the price and the free computers."

It is incredibly easy to meet people from all over the world, as their huge ballroom and frequent social events (free dinner 3 nights a week, beer…"
1,decent hostel,The Green Tortoise Hostel in San Franciso is your average hostel. The prices for rooms are fairly cheap and if you don't mind a lack of privacy - go for it. The rooms are quite spacious but sometimes not very clean. The building itself and the rooms are rather old which in my…
1,"Excellent, best hostel ive stayed in","Staff are very friendly, free dinner, clean, plenty of activities going on. Although it is located in the red light district, dont let that put you off, its a great hostel. It might come across as rundown and a bit hippy-ish judging by the decor but its perfect. Its completety…"

Staff was friendly and helpful, and i was roomed with mostly european travelers, and they were equally awesome. The free breakfast and…"
1,"All the attributes, but something lacking...","The Green Tortoise is located so that walking is easy enough to Union Square (20 mins), Montgomery BART Station (15 mins) and Fisherman's Wharf (30 mins), so the location can't really be knocked.  The hostel is quite large and seems to have thought of (nearly) everything that…"
1,One of the Best Hostels Around,"I was a bit cautious about the Green Tortoise... it's painted as a party hostel and whilst that did appeal, I was worried it would be impossible to sleep. But even though it was located on a busy street, I slept wonderfully each and every night (despite the Giant's win causing a…"
,"Great location, great vibe, great freebies","If you're on a budget and looking for a safe, central hostel, the Green Tortoise is for you.

,Setting an example for what hostels should be.,"Off of Broadway Ave. in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood lies good testament to the act of hostelling, The Green Tortoise. This is no name unknown to the frugal traveler. The Green Tortoise started as a bus that started taking people across country in green buses to see…"
1,A great stay in a colourful neighbourhood,OK - first things first.  This hostel sits slap bang in the middle of strip club central in San Fran - but don't hold that against it!  Its just shock when you first arrive and every other building has 'XXX' or 'Nude' flashing in red neon around you.  Strip clubs occupy most of…
,Meet people or sleep?,Green tortoise is not a place I'd pick to sleep good. I stayed there to meet people and that I did. There's a lot of backpackers there that probably is equally much looking for company.   You either sleep in rooms of two to eight people (usually bunk beds). The standard is very…
1,Great hostel in San Francisco,"The green tortoise is not only very conveniently located, but has also a great staff. They offer free dinners on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. and also other events all through the week. Not to forget the travel office which offers great bus tours all around the States. Very…"

,revolting,"I cannot believe some critics here. I was there for 3 nights. Breakfast could be for free, but it was disgusting moving around the kitchen looking for the eating service and realizing the dirtiness. We had just one (and enough) breakfast experience.  The room was OK, but VERY…"
,My favorite hostel in 8 months around the world,"Here are some of the reasons why I LOVED this hostel: free wifi, free internet, free breakfast (bagels, jams, peanut butter, juice, etc.), free vegetarian dinners thrice a week, free beer once a week (good fun at the beer olympics) and speech about free stuff going on in San…"
1,Interesting Experience.,So I'm pretty new to traveling. Haven't stayed at very many hostels so obviously a party oriented hostel like the green tortoise leaves a strong impression on my virginal hostel traveling mind. You have the potential to meet some very interesting people here but also some very…
,It's all about the party....,"The staff on arrival were great, and made sure we knew all there was to know about the place itself and had tourist maps of San Fran itself for us too. There was absolutely loads going on in this place - free breakfast (quite good, bagels, fruit, tea/coffee and juice), free…"
,"Mediocre, at best, Illegal, at worst.","This place is pretty average fare for a hostel. The staff describe it as a 'party hostel' which is pretty accurate. If your looking for a place with small rooms, shared showers, questionable cleanliness, and easy access to pot, this is the place to go. If your looking for…"
,GREAT Hostel. I loved it!,"This is the best hostel I've stayed so far. It is clean, with lots of computer terminals to use, and its easy to find one - internet is free. The floor is carpetted and that makes the place really comfy and cosy. The bathrooms are clean, and i didnt find it too long a wait to…"
1,Totally made my stay in San Francisco!,"First of all, San Francisco is the most amazing city I'd ever been too, so any accomadation is going to be just a base for your explorations rather than a make-or-break experience for your holiday. There are lots of  little 'quirky' things in the hostel which make it unique,…"
1,backpack standard,"Two night stay in this backpack standard hostel was fair enough. Its greatest value is in convenient position and low price. Staff is also pleasant, and facilities OK. I recommend for short stays, when alone."
,Best time of my life due to the Green.T .. miss it so much!!,"I came to San Francisco not knowing what to expect and had the time of my life .. i was on an acting course out there.. was meant to stay at the green.t for 3 weeks and stayed for 2 months!!

,Everything a hostel should be and more!,"The Green Tortoise might look a bit rough around the edges on first arrival but this hostel ticks every box if you are a backpacker looking to meet other people, hit all the cool spots of San Fran, save cash and take great tours.  It is absolutely awesome.  We stayed for 2…"
,"Seriously helpful staff, fun place to stay, great location!","We stayed for 5 days, it was great. We requested a quiet room (they have live events and a large communal area which can be noisy) and although the room was very small for 2 people, it had a sink (shared bathroom) and we hardly spent any time there. The hostel is in a great…"
,Made my trip - perfect base in San Fran and hostel was a lot of fun,"Ok, so if you are looking for somewhere quiet, in the nicest area downtown and like to spend evenings quietly reading or whatever, the Green Tortoise may not be for you.   If, on the other hand, you enjoy meeting fun travellers from all over the world, appreciate friendly staff,…"
1,Fun,"It's a hostel so you should know what to expect when it comes to slumber quarters... Aside from that the staff is awesome, the people who stay there are awesome, excellent locations,  plenty of social events throughout the week.  From what I have see it is definitely one of if…"
1,Friendly and Fun ... but,there are very few showers or toilets = long waits in the morning.  Also I had a little problem with some unwanted guests in my bed - and I'm talking about the type that bite.   That said the rest of the hostel was really clean so I'm hoping my experience was a one-off.  Great…
,"Fun, Warm, Messy, Homely Place to Stay in San Francisco","Our stay at Green Tortoise from 7th Aug for 2 nights was very memorable. We met a fellow singaporean there by an incredible stroke of luck. The staff was friendly, cheery and helpful. I personally love the messy atmosphere in GT.  Though messy in some areas, its bright homely…"
,This is the place to stay if you're young at heart and open minded!,"ok....   this was not the cleanest hostel i've ever stayed in, but it was the funnest!  it wasn't the cheapest hostel i've ever stayed in, but it was so well located that nothing would dissuade me from staying here again in the future.  free internet, free computers, free…"
,Amazing hostel that goes out of their way to make your trip the best it can be!,"We stayed at this hostel for a week and loved every minute of it. It is in a really cool, older building with lots of character. Why would you go to San Francisco and stay in a perfectly bland, expensive hotel when you have this place? There is a huge ballroom where lots of the…"
,Located in Red Light District & Rowdy Hostel,"This hostel is unbelivable, It's located in the red light district with all the drunkards & prostitues around the area. We are from Malaysia, We got in from New York, L-Hostel which was a total opposite of Green Tortoise. We didn't expect this kind of environment in a hostel.…"
1,This hostel is a destination in its self. Travel back in time to 1974.,Its hard to put it in words but the Green Tortoise in San Francisco is a very special place. If you stay here for a few days you can really get to know some of the coolest people from all over the world because of the atmosphere and freedom. The most social hostel Ive ever…
,"Old, tired looking hostel, with some unpleasant staff.","We booked into the GT from the sister hostel in Seattle, where we enjoyed our stay. The two are VERY different. We turned up to the hostel to find that it was in the middle of a red light zone, with topless bars and street girls around us. I didn't feel safe using the ATM across…"
,"Lovely people, clean rooms and close to everything!","We had a double room which was in a separate building for most of our stay which was clean and spacious. the night we stayed in a dorm room, again it was clean and had space to secure your things.   the common room was great and they let you get on with it on your own. it had a…"
,Got bit by fleas- AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!,"I've stayed at many hostels including Hostel International in the Tenderloin distric.

1,Great location for looking around San Fran,"This hostel is very friendly and convenient. It is old, with abstract carpet and a dark wooden appeal to it but it has everythign you need.

1,Best Hostel Ever!,I have stayed here a few time and I keep coming back! I love it! I read some bad reviews and those people obviously have never stayed in a hostel before and didn't take the time to compare what you would be paying to stay anywhere else in San Francisco. For the cheap prices it…
1,Green tortoise not for the faint hearted,This hostel has many pros and cons. The greeting from the reception staff is questionable and they messed up my booking. I stayed for 10 nights and was never greeted with any recognition. They Put on Breakfast everyday and dinner 3 times a week. The Dinners are great with lots…
1,really bad service,"they just tried to sell their adventure travels in a hurry, when I asked the reception how to go to Golden Gate Bridge! They even forgot to tell me they would lock the front door in the evening. When I came back at about 8:00pm, I couldn't open the door! I was so hopeless that I…"
,Check your room before you pay,"Well. To be fair, the hostels location is superb. Right next to North Beach(next to all the strip clubs, but hey). The facilities are okay, the kitchen could be bigger but it is well looked after and they throw on a free breakfast everyday and a free dinner three days a week.…"
,Better than I thought it would be,I found this hostel on tripadvisor.  My husband and I are not rich and wanted to visit San Francisco.  So hotels out there we found were in the range of $250 to $200 a night.  And Oracle conference was going on and there weren't any hotel rooms available anyway. So we decided to…
,Didn't think it was bad,"My boyfriend and I stayed at a private room for 2 nights at the Tortoise.  After reading some bad reviews, I was quite nervous to see what I would find out.  We kept the reservation because of the price but shortened it just in case it was just terrible.  The truth is that the…"
,Better than I expected!,"There are a lot of mixed reviews about this hostel, but out of the three hostels in San Francisco that I stayed in, the Green Tortoise was the most enjoyable overall with the friendliest, most sociable travellers.  The best aspects of the hostel are: * The fun atmosphere and…"

,"Was OK, nothing special","This hostel was OK, not the best but not the worst i've stayed in.  The biggest problem was getting the staffs attention, unless you were lucky enough to be the only person at the front desk you had to wait and wait and wait....they just took soooooo long at doing everything! …"

We found a new place straight away and lost the price of our first night but it was soooo…"
,Only Place To Stay,"The GT.  When I walked up the stairs I thought what the hell is this place.  It's run down.  Appearances tho can be deceptive.  It has character, the staff are friendly and you will be looked after.   The internet is free and crap sometimes but the place is clean and you will…"
,Must be better in SF,"We stayed here for 5 night in September. It had its plus points, such as a convenient location (2 mins Chinatown, 10 mins downtown, 10 mins Embarcadero) free breakfast, 3 tasty free dinners a week, free internet and a chilled friendly vibe. The 4 bed dorm we had was fine and we…"
1,The GT Ballroom is where it's at!,"I stayed two nights at the Green Tortoise SF. It's a hostel, so manage your expectations, but I found it to be relatively clean. The staff were somewhat world-weary, but ultimately helpful. The highlight of the GT SF is the ballroom. On a Sunday night they had a band playing …"
,Great relaxed vibe. Social Hostel,"If you're looking for a hostel with a bit of character and a relaxed friendly vibe then this is the hostel for you. Ok so the decor is not up to date, but in my opinion this is unimportant and it gives the hostel a unique character. There are 3 free meals a week, beer pong, pub…"
,A good place to stay in San Fran,"Near Little Italy and Chinatown (both lovely neighbourhoods!), surrounded by strip clubs (the unionized, worker owned Lusty Lady is not to be missed if you're into ""that kind of thing""), and a stone's throw from the City Lights Bookstore, this typical backpackers hostel is…"
,Not if you're scared of strangers using your bathroom,"The hostel was really friendly. It felt a bit like summer camp, the meals were good (breakfast every morning and 3 dinners a week provided), and there were all sorts of interesting people to talk with form all over the world. Also, the location is absolutely amazing and cannot…"
,"The Tortoise: Slow mover, but gets there in the end...","Now I rate this on the basis of it being a Hostel. I'm therefore not walking in there thinking I've booked a room at the Waldorf Astoria. As such, it does fine. I've seen better, but I've seen a lot worse. I've stayed in hostels all over Europe, this was my first in the USA. I…"
,A real flea pit!,The San Francisco Green Tortoise hostel is a real dump - after checking out the tiny dark dingy and dirty bedrooms with their grotty linen and stale smell our group decided that they could not tolerate even a single night here. The bathrooms were either under repair or dirty and…
,Great Location,"First impressions of this hostel weren't great. It wasn't the cleanest and seemed fairly grubby. But as I later learned most of the best hostels are like this around the world. Only my second stop on my world trip with my friends, we picked this place cos of the great reviews. …"
,Don't stay here ever.,"We booked this hostel after staying in Green tortoise in Seattle and finding the hostel just great.
