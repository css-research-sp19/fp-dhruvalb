Great Experience,"Writing this a little belated, but I stayed here almost a year ago. The fact that I am taking the time to write about it a year later says something.  Off the bat the staff was very helpful and friendly. They have a suggestion log from visitors of places to go, which was cute.‚Ä¶"
Be prepared to walk several blocks,"The hotel is okay (if you don't mind small rooms), but the only parking is on the street.

Great Value,"When you stay in San Francisco, your choices are $300-$500. This family owned and operated hotel is not in that price range. It's not fancy, but for a trip to the city, where you are spending your time enjoying the sights and phenomenal restaurants, this is where you sleep and‚Ä¶"

Nice but small rooms,We stayed here for one night. It was very clean. Not much light from outside. Felt cramped in room. But very good location and price. We stayed at the Casa Loma hotel down two blocks and preferred their full bath rooms over the metro due to light from outside and size of room.‚Ä¶
Neighborhood Gem!,"We were referring to this hotel because it was nearby to our friends, who live off of Alamo Square.  First, this hotel is a great value for the money.  It is clean and our room was not crammed.  The rooms do not seem to be huge - nor would i expect them to be for the type of‚Ä¶"

Okay but not overwhelming,"On the positive side and most importantly, the staff were very friendly and the accommodation was clean and tidy. Otherwise, the hotel was uninspiring.

Very pleased with this hotel,My husband and I are from Minnesota so we had no idea how to pick a hotel here.

Would tell a friend about it,"The staff, notably Shayna (spelling probably wrong), were very friendly and professional.

Adequate,"I stayed here for three nights in Mar 13 to attend a seminar relatively close by. The value to price ratio seemed high according to prior reviews.   I chose a third floor room in the back to avoid road noise (208).  There is some noise from a pizza joint that has ""outdoor""‚Ä¶"
Great value in San Fran,"This hotel is a bit out of the way of the central San Fran/Fishermans Wharf area, but it's easy enough to get to if you jump on the 71.

Best deal in town if city noise isn't a problem.,"  Love the room, simple, modern, cool view, comfortable bed, VERY CLEAN.

Good value but rooms are small,"The rooms are probably way too small, and though it suited me fine, my mum wasn't quite used to the lack of walking space.

We love this place.,My wife and I stayed there for several days and we loved it. It was very clean and the maid service was great.

Environmentally Friendly Hotel for the Budget Conscious,We knew we would get into San Fran late and worked it out with the front desk for the late check in.

This is a lovely, clean boutique hotel with small rooms, knowledgeable staff (during the day, night not so much!), excellent location for folks who‚Ä¶"
I wouldn't go back,We stayed here as part of a group in December. The hotel is small and very basic. Our friend's rooms were slightly bigger than ours but all were quite old-fashioned and very plain. Our room was so small we were constantly tripping over each other. No room for our bags‚Ä¶
Great Maids & Concierge,"I stayed at the Metro for 12 days in rm 112 for a medical procedure in the city. They put me in rm 112, the quietest room in the building. Usually, it was very quiet and private. On one weekend, there was a party or something nearby, perhaps at the restaurant downstairs, and it‚Ä¶"
Disaster Area...,"This hotel was without a doubt the worst place I have ever stayed in, in my life. Upon entry we trudged up the dreary stairs to be greeted by a tiny, dingy room which wouldn't look out of place in a mental hospital. There was barely enough room to put the suitcases on the ground‚Ä¶"
"Nice hotel with good, but noisy restaurant in the backyard",Metro Hotel...  we¬¥d stay there for three night. The room was nice furnitured and had a window to the backyard. The staff is very friendly and relaxed. The hotel shares the backyard with a french restaurant (good food for reasonable prices!).  This turned out to be a real‚Ä¶
Depressing Room!,"When this hotel was recommended to us for a quick weekend jaunt, I thought my husband and I were in the wrong place.  The room looked like something out of a mental hosptial.  No decor, nothing on the wall, no light and the floor was crooked.  The bathroom had a shower stall‚Ä¶"
Noise until 3:30AM,"My husband, myself, and our faimly stayed at the Metro December 3rd.  When we returned to the Metro for the evening a very loud band and talking and yelling began about 10:pm and continued until 3:30 AM.  It made our evening a nightmare.  When I reported it to the front desk we‚Ä¶"
"Great, convenient bargain!",We stayed in San Francisco for my husband's birthday and really just wanted somewhere to sleep as we knew we'd be out and about all the time.  It was small but so much cheaper than anything else we've seen in San Francisco.  If you're hoping for a room to spend more time in and‚Ä¶
plenty good,stayed there while going to see ufo at the independent across the street. i thought it was resonably priced at $99 a night for a room with 2 beds. the guy at the desk said next time book directly and i would get a better rate. room was very clean. a little noisey because our‚Ä¶
No Frills Just Basics,Rooms are average and there is only street parking which was quite a nightmare.  My husband and I stayed here to see an incredible show (Blackmoore's Night) at the Independent just a few blocks from the Hotel.  It was fine for our need.  Short stay and spending very little time‚Ä¶
Great value,"This is not a hotel with a tremendous amount of amenities.  That said, it's a great value for the money.  I stayed here for two nights in mid-October 2004 when I came up here last minute for some job interviews.  It was a perfect place to stay given my limited budget.  The‚Ä¶"
I expected more...,"I was in California from the end of March until the end of April 2004. My first ever trip to America and I LOVED CA!! LA, Anaheim, San Diego, Tahoe were all fantastic. Except for my 5 day stay at The Metro... I was really dissapointed. The desk staff were rude and not very‚Ä¶"
Best Deal in SF!,"For me, location in a hotel is everything. This hotel is a great find if you want to stay off of the tourist track yet be centrally located.  The rooms are quiant but adequite; filled with eclectic antique furniture.  Staff if extremely friendly and helpful.  This location is‚Ä¶"
