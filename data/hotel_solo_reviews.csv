Hotel has no restaurant or breakfast but loads of great coffee shops and places to eat nearby (and of course further afield).  Just…"
Very pleasant,"I wasn't expecting much when I booked a hotel in San Francisco for a hundred bucks  a night; but, in this instance I was pleasantly surprised.  The room is small.  Two people would find it a tight squeeze.  Simply furnished, no bedside lamps but ceiling lights.  Bed is small,…"
"Charming, cozy, amazing staff, good location","I stayed at the Metro 3 nights. Although I arrived early my room was ready so I got to check in. On my second day I switched rooms due to availability (this had already been planned) and so I lightly packed my things, left them in the 1st room, went exploring, and when I came…"
Cute budget accommodations,"I had a lovely stay at the Metro and would recommend it to those visiting San Francisco, with the caveat being it isn't your typical chain hotel.  Pros:  - clean - affordable - close to public transit - friendly, knowledgeable staff - some of the best food in town is on the same…"
"Charming, quirky & affordable make for a delightful visit","I stayed at The Metro for 3 nights in May 2018, choosing it largely because it was so affordable for San Francisco. Having stayed now, it’s clear this gem of a hotel is incredible value.  There was a lot to like about my stay, but the wonderful staff working at the hotel are…"
Back Home in San Francisco,"I used to live four blocks from this hotel. Its one of two hotels in the neighborhood. When I'm at the Metro I'm in a sense back home. The rooms are clean, the one I was in had just been updated. Each of the rooms in this hotel is a little different. This is a very nice hotel…"
A five star hotel without the fluffy BS,Fabulous. Clean. Modern. Helpful. Cheerful. Artistic and minimalist. Simple and yet full of just the right stuff. Everything you need is here. Everything you don’t need is not here. Perfect simplicity. So pleased.
A not-so hidden treasure,"I have been afraid to post this review, as I feel like this place is the best kept secret in SFO, and I want to keep it that way. But alas, they deserve to have it said that this the location, the price, and the staff of the Metro Hotel cannot be beat. Rooms are cozy, but have a…"
Super comfy and friendly,"This centrally-located hotel has some of the most comfortable beds I've experienced in a hotel, especially at this price level! In addition, there were two pillow types to choose from. The towels are thick and plush. I stayed on the top floor facing the street and was happy to…"
tiny hotel on the European model: very affordable for SF,"Well-located, clean hotel for exploring San Francisco, and unusually affordable for San Francisco. Small rooms and bathrooms. Really nice staff. Read the descriptions carefully -- they are accurate about how many people can stay in a room and what amenities each one has. The…"
Great urban refuge!,"Super cute, friendliest people every who work at and own the property, and extremely clean and peaceful rooms. I felt so comfortable here after long, hectic days and besides the hospitality, it's in a great neighborhood. Maybe a little small for families in one room, but…"
Small but suitable,"I have stayed here twice now after Burning Man. On both occasions I took a cheaper room as I was alone. The cheaper rooms are small with limited space and views.  My TV had no remote. I called reception but had no answer 4-5x, so I went down and asked them where it could be. The…"
Great experience,"Accommodations are simple, but comfortable and very clean. The location is great: easy to walk to parks, restaurants and other neighborhoods. The best part of my experience was taking the advice of the staff member who checked me in. She recommended a great place nearby for…"
Great place!,Great location and no frills makes this very affordable and surrounded by lots to do.  Angela was unbelievably helpful especially when it came to parking!  I look forward to staying again.  It was easy to find and has lots of great history and art work.
Memorial Day getaway,"This is a quaint, old-style hotel with few amenities, but it has the most important qualities, as far as I'm concerned.  The staff is friendly, my room was immaculate, and it was quiet, even though I chose a room facing Divisadero street.  The location could be a little better,…"
just overnight,"This is a gem of a place to stay. Nicely located with affordable prices. The bed was fantastic, very comfortable with a nice assortment of pillows to choose from. The front desk was great, helpful and friendly. I will definitely stay here again."
Welcoming and Great Value,This hotel makes you feel you have come home—all the staff are so friendly and welcoming. When you stay here you are staying in a neighborhood. You get to feel what it would be like to live here in this part of San Francisco. You do not feel like part of the tourist throng. The…
"Clean, comfortable, fresh!!","Like others, I highly recommend this unique boutique hotel. As a female traveling alone, I felt safe and got a great sleep in a comfy bed!!  I had room 209 which looked out into a fun courtyard. By 9 pm it was quiet. City noise was minimal. No elevator but I opt for stairs…"
Like Family,Although I had read many positive reviews of The Metro I still had reservations about staying here. Once I arrived I understood why everyone loves this place. The desk staff are wonderful and go out of their way to make you feel at ease. My room 201 had great windows and a…
"Great location, great value","A great hotel for a few days' stay in San Francisco. Offers everything you need; simple, comfortable and clean place to stay - plus it's very affordable compared to the other hotels in the city. The location is very convenient, you can easily walk to interesting places. Bus…"
Great Value in an Expensive City,"This hotel is not exactly in the Haight Ashbury district, however, it is only a few blocks away. The price is very reasonable if you compare with other hotels in San Francisco. I have stayed in Haight Ashbury before, but I found that I prefer The Metro over the other hotel I…"
Great experience..,"What can I write that has not been written before.. You can not ask for a better value for the money. My trip was scheduled around a visit to de Young Museum and the location of this hotel was ideal... Knowledgeable and helpful staff makes all the difference, and I couldn't ask…"
"Great value, cosy room in an excellent spot",I stayed in the Metro Hotel for a week in mid-April and could barely have asked for better as a solo traveller on my first visit to SF. The staff on reception were without exception welcoming and helpful. The room and especially the bed were comfortable and it was a pleasure to…
A Little Gem in San Francisco,"I came here alone in early March. Room was in the back, small, overlooking the restaurant garden. Queen bed. Quiet at night. Extremely clean and recently renovated. Perfect for one or a couple.  Neighborhood is a major plus if you want to avoid touristy downtown and business…"
What a fantastic hotel!  2nd time staying here.,"This isn't a fancy place, but it is sophisticated, in that it reminds me of staying in Europe.  You come and go as you like and the rooms are simple but all you need.    I stayed in a room with a full-size bed.  Small, yes, but when you stay on your own and see the city, how big…"
"Friendly, clean, off the beaten path and a great value","I live in the area but decided to spend an overnight in San Francisco one night so I could have a late night out and still make it on time to work the next morning. I searched and searched and all of the hotels were overpriced, in a highly touristed area or reasonably priced but…"
Clean bed and bathroom,"The Metro is centrally located with easy access to MUNI. If all you want is a clean bed and private bathroom, this is the place for you!  There's plenty of outlets in the room along with a wall mount TV. Plenty of shelf space and a closet. Quiet and CLEAN. Parking is not…"
Affordable Stay in Hip New 'Hood,"OK, the neighborhood and the hotel are not new, but this San Francisco neighborhood, NoPa (North of the Panhandle) is recently hip.   The Metro is not fancy, but it's cool and funky. Tip: ask for a blow dryer at the front desk when you check in, as they don't put one in your…"
Great hotel to stay,"Where shall I start?  I stayed for 5 days in one of the smaller rooms on my last trip to SF, and because of that, I had the chance to meet every one of the staff. They are all absolutely amazing, very friendly and helpful. Giving me directions to get good locally supplied…"
Fantastic value for money,"A family member's recommendation confirmed by online reviews led me to the Metro Hotel, in the Haight district and convenient to Alamo Square, the Hayes Valley shops, and Golden Gate Park. The price was rock bottom, the staff unusually helpful, the WiFi free, and the room,…"
Awesome Stay at Metro Hotel!,"I traveled solo to San Francisco for some good old R&R (and to escape Boston's awful weather). Not only was the hotel in a spectacular location close to public transportation, bars, local restaurants & cafes, and shops, the staff was amazing! They were all extremely welcoming…"
Great value,"Upon entering my room, it struck me as pretty plain. And it is. There are no frills, like toiletries, hair dryer, etc. but the room and bathroom were spotless. Not often do you find a decent hotel room for this price. It worked great for me because it is located in a residential…"
Only good things to say,"Wonderful little place in a absolutely charming area! I mean, you get sort of what you pay for, but the room was pretty cosy and CLEAN! The staff is very nice and helpful. Best of all, however, is that I discovered that the best thing is not to live directly in the city center,…"
"Clean, friendly, comfy room","The Metro Hotel has an excellent location in the Haight.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are nothing fancy, but nice, clean, and comfortable.  I stayed in an ""interior"" room, which had a ""view""of the hallway to the back garden, which is shared by the…"
San Francisco’s best kept secret for budget accommodation,"I stayed at the Metro Hotel for five days in late August.  I was a little apprehensive staying here because I was warned that San Francisco was an expensive city for accommodations, and the Metro was very affordable....was there a reason it was so inexpensive?   Rest assured,…"
Great staff and great location,For an inexpensive hotel this place is clean and well situated in Haight. The staff were All super friendly and offered lots of good advice for things to do and see and eat in SF. Room was small with no safe but clean and adequate. Highly recommend. 
just right,"Clean, neat, good neighborhood, no problems. Staff helpful and polite. I'd forgotten toothpaste and they gave me a travel tube. I believe that for the price in SF this was a good deal (though I didn't look around too much). Nothing luxurious--and no elevator--but just what I was…"
Great value!,"Clean, safe, convenient accommodation for under a hundred dollars. Close to the bus, easy access to many parts of town and a short shuttle from the airport. Desk staff were polite enough. Thanks for a great stay :)"
My favourite place to stay in SFO,"Went there the first time in 2013 after a recommendation by a friend. Very clean, reasonable prices (I paid much more for much less in SFO), extremely friendly and helpful staff. Take your chance to explore the neighbourhood, there are some really nice cafes and bars just around…"
Clean and tidy with knowledgable and polite staff.,Booked this room as it was near friends i was visiting. It was clean and tidy with a decent sized shower. I only used it at night as i was out most of the day. The staff on reception were polite. The room i booked said it was above a restaurant and had a chance of noise but i…
It Felt Very Homey,For my first visit to San Francisco for my birthday I definitely chose the right place! Even during booking the staff was very helpful. I was told the only room left during my stay was upstairs with a small window. I was a little worried but the location seemed to good to be…
"Great location, Clean hotel, Tiny room, Tiny price","I read all the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I was completely happy with my stay.  I was in room 207 and it was just me.  I will start with the two negatives, no elevator and my room was tiny.  I did not need a big room so it was fine for me.  The hotel has a clean and…"
Very good value,"I was visiting family and I wanted something close by so I thought Id give it a shot. The staff was always super nice on the phone or in e-mail. The rooms are really tiny a bed, mirror, small closet kind of area,TV,sink & bathroom with shower and thats it. There is free wifi,…"
Great service and communication,"I made a reservation with the Metro Hotel for some family coming from out of town for my wedding.  From the beginning - which was months prior to the event -- the Metro Hotel was easy to work with.  They sent an email confirmation of my initial reservation, contacted me when…"
Worth the price,"This hotel is definitely worth its price. Rooms are not spacious (= tiny), but they are well maintained and impeccably clean, and the beds are very comfy. Hotel has good location close tho many public transport lines.  For a traveler not caring much about hotel luxury and…"
Friendliest Hotel,I stayed at the Metro and enjoyed many happy conversations with the people behind the desk. The rear or front rooms are the best. At the rear I could sit outside on the balcony often and enjoy a beer. There can be noise from traffic and a downstairs restaurant so take ear plugs…
What a Gem,"I stayed here for one night in June 2013.  This was the only room available for the whole month.  This is a popular hotel that needs to be reserved in advance.  I had room 103 overlooking the street.  There was some street noise, but I had the window open.  There is a restaurant…"
"Just as described, good choice","The Metro is just as described, light, and a nice building. Good location for local places to eat and drink nearby. Buses to the centre at the end of the road. Friendly staff.Good choice and price for SF."
"Comfortable, Clean, and the Best Kind of Quirky","The Metro is the kind of hotel that I try and find when I'm researching on TripAdvisor -- well-kept, well-located, and a good deal. It doesn't hurt that the staff is friendly & competent and that the entire facility is by no means ""cookie cutter.""  I was concerned about street…"
"My new ""Go To"" home away from home","Found this gem through the recommendations on Trip Advisor. This is not the place for you if you want to do all the ""touristy"" spots on the waterfront/Union Square, unless you are comfortable with the use of public transportation (ie:busses). The rooms are very small, but so is…"
Best hotel staff in America,"This hotel is a bargain in a terrific neighborhood. The Lower Haight is so vibrant and so well served by public transportation that you won't miss staying downtown. Besides, this is a lot closer to Golden Gate Park. Get the staff's suggestions on places to eat. There are dozens…"
Perfect budget hotel,"This hotel does everything a hotel must do perfectly well (good bed, clean, bathrooms fine) and does nothing of what a hotel doesn't have to (no room service, no huge lobby, etc.)  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The two extras I saw were a nice sitting garden in the…"
Room 107. Best deal in town. Period.,"I have been to SFO many times over the past years and obviously spent way too much on hotels.  That is, until I found the Metro...  $76/night within walking distance of the Haight, Castro, the Mission, with clean rooms and linens and friendly staff.  Really?  Yes, a great budget…"
Basic lodging at a great value,"Convenient location, very clean, welcoming and knowledgeable staff. A blackboard in the lobby lists local events and is flanked by bookshelves with San Francisco guidebooks--a thoughtful touch that's indicative of the neighborliness of this place. Two excellent coffeeshops and a…"
Really good Haight area San Francisco budget hotel,"My solo stay was in room 106 for 4 nights in Feb 2013 and  I very much agree with the consensus of the reviews here. In many ways the Metro deserves 5 stars, but it has some drawbacks, as might be expected at the price, so It could be misleading to rate it as a five.  First -…"
Nice Stay,"Terrific little hotel in cool neighborhood. A great value for the price. And I thought it was kinda cool that the windows in my room actually open... (Not that I wanted them open since it was cold and rainy outside, but still.....:)  Also, check out the cool little pizza spot…"
Great price nice cosy hotel,"The front desk guys are awesome and really make this place. It was exceptional value - rooms more than big enough. It is in lower Haight, not right in the thick of things but has it's own community. A ten dollar cab over the hill to the Castro. I was there mid week and in a room…"
"""No Frills"" NoPa Hotel","I stayed here one night, on the second floor, in room 114. Like the title says, it is a no frills room. There is just the basics. You have a bed, a table, a chair, a flat screen tv on the wall, really no other room decorations. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The…"
Great Stay,This hotel was a little further away from the sightseeing I was doing then I would have liked to be but the room was clean and update and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Do be aware that you must use stairs to get to your room. I would definitely stay here again if…
You'll never want to stay anywhere else EVER!!!,"The Metro Hotel is the perfect place to stay if you're looking for something clean, cozy, affordable, friendly, and simple. The staff makes you feel right at home and are full of helpful advise. The Metro is located near many of the cities most historic and culturally diverse…"
"Chic, affordable convenience","Visiting a relative in San Francisco was greatly enhanced by staying at the Metro Hotel in the Lower Haight neighborhood where he lives.  The staff are enthusiastically friendly, knowledgeable locals.  The hotel itself has been recently renovated, and it somewhat reminded me of…"
Comfortable!,"Great little hotel, I arrived to find I had a free room upgrade (this suited me fine).  The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable and at a fantastic price. The staff were helpful and gave me great advise of local attractions and good coffee stops. Close to a hop on hop…"
"I love this hotel, but","The good news: great neighborhood, easy transit access to all of SFO, front desk folks super helpful and cheery. Not so great news: no bathtubs, little to no heat, no closets, tiny rooms. After 3 nights in street-front room, they moved me to the studio apartment and it was too…"
"Great location, budget friendly, simple","I came into the hotel with the understanding that is a no frills hotel, and I got what I paid for - to be in a great neighborhood out of downtown. The receptionist was nice and recommended spots to park my car. It's within close distance to some great restaurants, and a quick…"
Small but excellent,"This hotel is great on a budget.  The rooms are smaller and you need to bring your own hair dryer, shampoos, ect.  That being said, I never experienced costumer service that was this great at a reasonably priced hotel.  The staff were very friendly and very helpful.  I would…"
Metro Hotel - positive vibes,"A recent 3 night stay at the Metro Hotel was a positive experience.  While simple and small, my room was clean, the shower was always hot, the bed firm .  The big bonus features are the friendly, helpful staff, location and the great value in an expensive city.  Despite being…"
Great!,"Great place, great location, very friendly and helpful staff.  It can get a bit noisy in my room as the wall shared that of the restaurant next door, but not enough for me to be bothersome, but it may to others."
Best Buy in San Francisco,"A family operated little hotel.  The rooms are small but very clean.  The service is good, the location is excellent, and in a great neighborhood.  The price is unbelievably reasonable for San Francisco.  The only drawback is that parking can be a problem, a person takes their…"
The Best Customer Service - The Best of Authentic San Francisco,"This is a gem of a place... the folks that run this place are among the sweetest, most welcoming people on the planet.  I cannot think of any place I would rather stay when I visit San Francisco."
"Great budget hotel close to the Haight, not luxury by any means, but a reasonable place to stay on the cheap.","Great place for the budget/no frills traveler.  After reading some of the negative reviews before and after staying here, all I can say is it's a budget hotel, and some people think they can get a four star room for under a hundred bucks.  For what I paid, the room was more than…"
Nothing but good things to say about this hotel,This is the most positive experience I have ever had from a hotel and I would go out of my way to recommend it to anyone visiting San Francisco. Everything concerning this hotel has been a breath of fresh air and I have first hand experience of the alternatives!  The staff are…
Just Like Home -- Because It Is!,"I am a San Franciscan who has to live elsewhere because of my job.  I come back as often as I can to visit family and friends, and have been staying at the Metro for many years now, instead of with family, because I like to have my privacy.  This hotel is perfect for people like…"
Very basic but clean and well-maintained,"I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and striking out on Priceline and finding high hotel prices in most other San Francisco hotels due to the Bay to Breakers race that weekend.  Don't look for Hyatt and Hilton type service or amenities here, but if you don't need that…"
