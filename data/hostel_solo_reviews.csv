This hostel is a destination in its self. Travel back in time to 1974.,Its hard to put it in words but the Green Tortoise in San Francisco is a very special place. If you stay here for a few days you can really get to know some of the coolest people from all over the world because of the atmosphere and freedom. The most social hostel Ive everâ€¦

Best Hostel Ever!,I have stayed here a few time and I keep coming back! I love it! I read some bad reviews and those people obviously have never stayed in a hostel before and didn't take the time to compare what you would be paying to stay anywhere else in San Francisco. For the cheap prices itâ€¦
Green tortoise not for the faint hearted,This hostel has many pros and cons. The greeting from the reception staff is questionable and they messed up my booking.

Gross and Dirty - No Service - Questionable Neighbourhood,"I stayed at this hostel for two nights in November and can honestly say, I will not be back.  Point form impression:  - almost 10 blocks from BART (last block uphill)  - neighbourhood: strip joints and porn shops (I didn't go out at night, so I cannot comment on personnalâ€¦"
The GT Ballroom is where it's at!,"I stayed two nights at the Green Tortoise SF. It's a hostel, so manage your expectations, but I found it to be relatively clean. The staff were somewhat world-weary, but ultimately helpful. The highlight of the GT SF is the ballroom. On a Sunday night they had a band playing â€¦"
