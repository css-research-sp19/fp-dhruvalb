San Francisco City Center Hostel,Best hostel I've ever stayed in,"This place is just gorgeous - the decor, the bar/Breakfast area, the communal areas, the antique elevator - and the beds are extremely comfortable and well furnished with light and usb ports. Extremely nice staff and a very well-equipped kitchen area. The only thing I will say, and it's totally not the hostel's fault, but the area it's in is awful - dirty and over run with homeless. It's heartbreaking and I hope that San Francisco can come to terms with these challenges soon. However, the hostel does extremely well to make its guests feel secure and safe.",5/19/2019,5,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great Hostel - just note location,"Hostel itself is great, clean rooms, friendly staff and a cool vibe. We felt sorry for the staff/owners as the hostel itself is perfect, you just have to beware of the location and that isn’t their fault at all. Our twin room was large and clean, breakfast was great and the dollar pancakes are a steal. There’s a large common area with plenty of couches and seperate seating areas.

The area attracts a lot of homeless people and junkies, who line both sides of the street at night. Being a larger male, I’m not really worried about them but my girlfriend did not feel safe walking in the evening/after dark so we took a lot of Ubers. We also come from a very safe/small city without a huge homeless population so if you are from a larger city you will probably feel more comfortable. Regretfully we ended up using the refunding night policy as we wanted to move closer to union square and walk in the evenings. The staff are also very good with security at night so there is no risk inside the hostel/directly out front. We also didn’t have any issues with the noise as mentioned by other reviewers, it was quiet in our room and we had no trouble sleeping.

If you are a traveler who is comfortable with dealing with homeless people at night, this hostel will be great but if you have reservations about it you would be best to look at a different area of town, or be prepared to pay for ride share services. Although everywhere in town will have issues with the homeless population.",5/19/2019,4,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Terrible Location ,"The private room was clean and check-in was easy, but the location is terrible. Worst street in SF. We truly felt unsafe and the front desk even told us not to walk around at night. Homeless people lined the streets with visible drug use and we even found a syringe on the floor as we stepped out in the am. It was therefor surprising the room did not have a deadlock on it. Could not recommend",5/19/2019,2,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Budget stay at a very good location,"The hostel is very nice..I stayed in a shared accommodation. Bed was comfortable and the toilet was clean. Breakfast was good. The staff members are very helpful. The decor has a taste of global spirituality. The location is also very good. The neighborhood, specially in the late night feels unsafe because of a large gang of vagabonds who seem to converge at this place post evening but they did not disturb me. A perfect place to stay if you are on a limited budget.",4/19/2019,4,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,"
Very eclectic and comfortable.","This place is so cool! Very spiritual property and so comfortable! Handicap accessible room worked perfect! I loved the $1 eggs and pancakes too! Several homeless people in this area, but they don’t bother you. Grocery store a few feet away so you can cook your own meals in the super clean kitchen. Most staff friendly like Sean, and Loved the manager! Carpet on floors in rooms needs replacing badly.",2/19/2019,5,Family
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great hostellar... location should be treated with care and respect,"Easy to find .. friendly welcome and easy check-in... stayed two nights ... double room ..clean, very comfy bed (might have been my first memory mattress experience!) good sized room heated via a very efficient old school type radiator, centrally controlled .. continental style breakfast included with the additional choices of either 4 cooked eggs or pancakes for $1 ... excellent idea.Lounge comfortable and relaxing based on a Gothic /Mexican Night of the Dead theme .. it works well. An old building which has been revamped but has retained it's old style effective gated lift .. nice touch.
Hostel is located on edge of Tenderloin district which has highest number of homeless people in America .. I walked everywhere during daytime (have developed somo wrestlers' thighs after those hills) and wasn't hassled or 'begged' once .. I did receive one of the most beautiful smiles I've had for a long time after making eye contact and smiling at a street person. Treat people with respect; smile when eye contact is made and acknowledge their presence; you shouldn't be using your phone on the streets anyway nor flashing your wealth. The location is only thing that stops me awarding an excellent.",1/19/2019,4,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Nice hostel,"I found the hostel very nice, the beds were comfy and the showers worked well. Breakfasts were really good bagels were basically your only option or for $1 you could get 4 eggs or some pancakes which is an absolute deal. The kitchen was ok it would be good if there was some more surfaces to prepare food as when a few people are cooking there is not much room. The lift was uncool with the old style sliding door. The area has lots of homeless people and some people found the area rough but personally I never had a problem. The people at the desk were fine. I found the location was find if you were willing to walk for public transport, about 10 mins to bart and cable car start etc.",1/19/2019,4,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great place in a very rough neighborhood,"THE GOOD - Helpful friendly staff, clean cozy rooms, free breakfast and a terrific $ 1 breakfast deal (4 eggs or pancakes or any combo thereof), generous public areas with nooks galore, books and games to loan, low cost in-house beer and wine “pub” (only open at night).
THE BAD - the neighborhood is pretty rough. Last part of San Francisco with sub-stratospheric lodging costs, the sidewalks of the Tenderloin are clogged with winos, crazies and junkies as well as garden-variety homeless. The front desk hands out foam earplugs. Get some.
THE FIX - Uber in and out if you’re female, watch your step on the street whoever you are, don’t walk up or down Golden Gate Street or Ellis more than absolutely necessary. Staying here is good value for the $ and walk two blocks up to Geary for a different (and safer) vibe. Whatever you do, avoid the 100 - 500 blocks of Ellis - that stretch of road is is as bad as I have ever seen",1/19/2019,4,Business
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great Hostel!,"Staying at the City Center Hostel has been great! The hostel has so many common areas for sitting on your own and reading a book-- or joining other travellers and making new friends. It is very quiet in the rooms and we even had our own very clean bathroom in a four bed dorm. The beds are very comfortable which is great after a busy day of sightseeing. The location of the hostel made for great excursions within walking distance--Fishermans Wharf, Chinatown, Haight -Ashbury, Mission District and the Golden Gate Park were all within easy walking distance. The Golden Gate Bridge is a little farther but the walk is worth it if you take the trail along the beach. Staff were very helpful, there is a bar on site, breakfast, and coffee/tea all day. The kitchen area is huge-lots of room to cook or store your food. Thanks for the great stay",12/18/2019,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Exceeded my expectations,"This hostel is an attraction on its own - the common areas are beautifully decorated with local art, each room representing one of San Francisco's bohemian neighbourhoods. They also have a bar serving local beer for affordable price, which is a great place to meet with other travellers in the hostel. Will definitely come back!",12/18/2019,5,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,No good,"We stayed at the hostel for 6 days and found the staff at reception to be very unhelpful and a bit rude.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Comfortable and Clean,"We booked a private room with ensuite. The room is comfortable. 
NO tv, No coffee, food or drinks allowed in the room.
,Room faced the street so there was noise during the nightand early morning.
Breakfast starts at 7.30 am
Hot breakfast 8.30 am.
There is a great kitchen to cook and prepare your own food with fridges available for food storage.
The hostel is located in Tenderloin,
Please do your research on the area before booking. 
We traveled via the Bart train from the airport ,which is easy,arriving in Union Square.
Highly recomend using Taxi/ Uber to Hostel or along Powell St to Geary St then 2 streets down at the corner to Ellis. 
The area has social problems which can be very confronting",10/18/2019,3,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Nice building, not so nice area.","Not a shock but the location is in a rough area, our first walk was just awful and we uber'd from then on. The building is nice and our private double was very spacious (expensive though, not a 'hostel' price). I know this is a hostel but the wifi's inability to work consistently beyond the 2nd floor is downright fustrating. Lots of rules for staying here, enjoyed the breakfast and the happy hour bar, the staff were fine (the lady with her own unique style (sorry didnt catch name) was particularly pleasant). Id recommend staying here to some friends, but only the hipster ones (and not lone female travellers).",10/18/2019,2,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great hostel,"My husband and I got a private room. It was our second visit and the hostel met all we could wish for again.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,"
Great on the inside, downright scary on the outside…","The trip from BART civic center to the hostel was one of the scariest walks of a lifetime. Homeless and drugs everywhere, we saw needle use on the street. A word to the wise...Uber to there. And from there. 

Once inside, we enjoyed the place. The bar had $4 pints. The room was comfortable and clean. We had a private room and bath. 

No AC so we slept with open windows. Since we were inside we found the sounds of the city entertaining, even if we were awoken by sirens or cussing. Downright scary if one was outside however.",10/18/2019,3,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Pleasantly surprised,"Yes, the location is pretty bad if let it get to you. I walked the streets as a Solofemale just by myself and was completely fine and it takes you about five minutes to get to a better part of the city. Also there are at least five Vietnamese restaurants (which I love) and a convenience store to buy drinks around the corner. The hostel itself is cute, styled with an eye for detail and staff is doing their best to make you feel safe, checking everyones room pass on entrance. I stayed in a four bed room where we even had our own bathroom which was a very pleasant surprise considering it is a hostel. The room and bathroom were both clean and the beds comfortable, the lockers had a good size for our luggage. Breakfast is very basic, but they offered eggs and pancakes for just one dollar which I find very generous in a city as expensive as San Fran.",9/18/2019,4,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Area ruins the hostel!,"As a female Solotraveller I had to cut my 4 night stay to 1 due to the unsafe nature of the area. On my walk to the hostel on my first day I was followed and then harassed for my phone and bag, luckily a passerby helped and walked me to the hostel. Then around 4pm I was waiting for an Uber outside the hostel and there were a group of homeless openly injecting drugs on the street. I’ve never felt so frightened and intimidated despite travelling alone countless times. When arriving to the hostel the woman on the desk was friendly but downplayed the area massively and said it was safe to walk alone when it clearly wasn’t. Doom was fine, beds and bathroom very clean. I’m sure it’s much better if travelling in a group but I definitely didn’t feel safe when there.",9/18/2019,2,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Not worth it,"Would not recommend (just based purely off location). I was supposed to stay 3 nights, but reduced down to 1. Could not leave hostel without being inundated with/leered at by homeless people - I felt so unsafe I ubered a one street distance. Could also hear homeless people from bedroom. Staff friendly and quite a cute hostel, but not worth it - especially as a Solotravelling female.",9/18/2019,2,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Fantastic hostel, concerning location","Pros - The hostel itself provided a great experience! It was clean, the building was beautiful, and it was a really social hostel and easy to meet interesting people. I would highly recommend getting a drink at the hostel bar and the egg & pancake breakfast for $1. 

Con - The location is not ideal due to the large homeless population and drug activity in the area. Although I never felt in danger walking around, it was very concerning and overwhelming at times, so just be prepared for that. I would recommend taking a taxi or uber to the hostel when you first arrive (rather than walking or busing in like I did), so that you can get a feel for the area first. I never had any safety issues during the day, however I avoided walking around at nights which was unfortunate, because I enjoy experiencing the nightlife when I visit new places. Otherwise, the location is close to most other major city sites, and is a good way to see a part of SF that you may not otherwise experience.",8/18/2019,4,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Sleepless night as other traveler did not care and staff could not be bothered,"Staff makes sure that you sign that you have read all the rules, but the they do not care so much if someone does not stick to the rules. Girl came into our room in the middle of the night, about 2 am and decided to take a bath in the ensuite bathroom. This took very long, we could hear everything. I asked her in a friendly way if she could take a shower instead but she said she deserved a bath to relax after having a long drive and she did not care if people could not sleep because of her. I asked at the reception for help and the guy could not be bothered. It could have been so easy if he told her that she would pay a fine for violating the rules. Some people otherwise don't care.",5/18/2019,2,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Nice hostel good service,"We stayed in a private room which means you have your own bathroom and toilet.

This is nothing to worry about because the people will not bother you.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Take the tour!,"Stayed at this hostel and took the free tour of China town with Anthony. It was totally amazing.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Quirky and Cute, but a bit of a Dodgy Location","We stayed at the hostel for 4 nights at the end of the July, and were very pleased with the actual hostel! It was super quirky and cute on the inside, the beds were comfy enough and the staff were beyond helpful! They also kept a close eye on who was coming in and out of the hostel, so we felt super safe with them on the door! On top of that, breakfast were decent- good toast and cheap eggs if you wanted that option- not much more we could’ve asked for in that regard! 

In saying that, I don’t think we’d be back. Although the location was close to the city centre and everything you could need (ie the F market tram which took us everywhere), it was in a super dodgy area! We read that there were a lot of homeless people around and thought we’d be okay because we live in a city in Australia, so have seen a lot of homelessness- but this was excessive. Walking on the street really scared us as two girls in our twenties, and we couldn’t walk around at night so we’re forced to take a lot of short Uber rides from door to door. In fact, one of our Uber’s even said to us as he dropped us off- ‘be safe girls, and don’t walk around at night- this is the area that you literally will get raped on’, so it was pretty bad! 

The staff were wonderful and did all they could to keep us safe- and nothing happened to us, but just wanted to stress what you’re in for. Sologirl travellers should spend more and pick somewhere else.",7/18/2019,3,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Book here!,"A really fun quirky hostel. I have stayed in a number of hostels all over the world and this ranks right up there. Really cool, quirky interior. The breakfast with local fresh-baked bagels is awesome. And the $1 pancakes and eggs the best dollar I spent in the US. The rooms are basic but perfectly adequate and I got a good nights sleep. As others have said, lots of homeless but now I've seen someone shooting heroin so it's a life experience I guess!?",7/18/2019,4,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Funky hostel in the Tenderloin District,"Stayed for five nights in a private room with ensuite. Even though the room was little, it was really clean and well appointed. The staff were helpful and friendly (mostly) and were diligent on security, which being in the Tenderloin District is important.

I thought the hostel was really funky and we loved the fact that breakfast was included in the price! We did opt for the $1 additional charge for eggs and pancakes one morning!

So, the Tenderloin District....I had read reviews saying that there were homeless people near the hostel, but didn't really worry about it when I booked. However there are a LOT of homeless people, we were really shocked by how many there were, how obvious the drug problems are, and also how dirty the streets were. Having said all that the homeless people do leave you alone and we quite quickly got used to the environment. One great part about the Tenderloin is there are some really good restaurants and it is really well positioned in the city.

If you are prepared for the homeless situation, I would highly recommend this hostel and would definitely go back. Travelling is all about new experiences - and we certainly got that!!",6/18/2019,5,Couple

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great hostel in a solid location,"If you are looking for a private, comfortable, and quiet room and not pay for the usual San Francisco hotel prices then this is a great option. I booked a private room which had my own bathroom and incredibly comfortable bed. Pretty much like a boutique hotel with other rooms having dorms etc. The front of the house staff are nice and efficient, the bar is fun at night with cheap drinks, and there's a cheap breakfast option or a free option as well based on what you prefer. 

I took the BART to Powell Street and walked along Ellis St. to the hostel. The walk only took me about 10 - 15 minutes. However, if you are from a city with not a lot of homeless people you might find this walk and the neighbourhood quite interesting. I am from Toronto so this didn't faze me. Don't be fooled by the neighbourhood though, it has a lot of character and cool bars/restaurants. 

I've stayed in a lot of hostels around the world and I have to say this is a great option when visiting San Francisco. Wouldn't think twice about booking here again.",5/18/2019,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Affordable Rooms and great atmosphere,"Stayed here for 3 nights in a private room. It was a welcome change from a typical hotel culture. It has great common areas and people from all over the world. There's a bar with affordable drinks inside, free breakfast of bagels/coffee/tea/fruit, and for $1 you can get eggs & pancakes made to order!

It's surrounded by great affordable food and a small bodega is right on the corner if you need any daily supplies.

It's true as many reviewers say that it's in a rather bad neighborhood in the city. But we already knew that and to be honest it wasn't as bad as some people put it. I wouldn't recommend walking nearby at night but during the day it's fine. The rooms are spacious, have a private bathroom, and are cleaned every day. The staff is nice in general, some of them were definitely better than others but they were great as a whole. And the best part of this hostel, it offers an amazing free breakfast with toast, fruit, coffee, bagels.... and eggs and pancakes for 1 dollar more.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Boutique hotel vibe in the Tenderloin.,"This is one of three HI hostels in SF. City Center is by far the best. It has the air of a boutique hotel. The lobby is comfortable and inviting. The bar/cafe area has a cozy, hardwood ambiance that you won't find in a hotel. We stayed in #609, which surprisingly had an incredible view. (I was in town visiting family, who lamented that their Big Fancy Hotel had a view of the adjacent building, about 10 feet out of the window, and not much else - ha, ha!)

We enjoyed the old school elevator, making me nostalgic for a time I never actually lived in, but admire nonetheless. The room was clean, quiet, and relaxing. We dug it, and will surely be back. Breakfast was an unexpected treat - eggs and pancakes for a buck? DEAL.

The Tenderloin neighborhood isn't the cleanest or nicest. Lots of homeless folks, and would advise keeping your head on a swivel after dark. But that doesn't affect how nice it is inside the hostel - a welcome oasis after walking for blocks through gritty SF.",4/18/2019,5,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Funky and clean,"First of all, beware of the location of this hostel. It is located downtown, with walking distance to many things but it is in a dodgy area and if you are not comfortable around homelessness and other less fortunate people then you may need to reconsider staying here. However I never felt unsafe. 

We shared a 4-bed dorm even though it is listed as a 5-beds. I was pretty impressed with how clean the place is. Breakfast is good, nothing fancy. 

The staff can come across as cold and short, but there was always a sense of friendliness around.",4/18/2019,4,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Unfriendly Staff, Scary Neighborhood!","Neighborhood: apparently it is located in Tenderloin neighborhood (a high-crime neighborhood -- Wikipedia). I was walking from Civic Center to this hostel at a rainy night (9pm), and it was a scary experience! Groups of people were lingering around, suddenly somebody was shouting/cursing/yelling/mumbling/singing. I felt super unsafe!
(I still felt unsafe when I was walking around in the morning 9am)

Staff: Unfriendly. The staff harshly demanded me to show Security Card (I didn't know what that was, I had not checked in & I haven't stayed at any HI before) in a very unfriendly tone. He finally understood that I had not even checked in. His unfriendliness set a negative vibe.

No complaints about the cleanliness, the bed, and the room, though",3/18/2019,2,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great price for a short stay.,"I stayed at City Center for two nights with a friend. The hostel was clean and most of the staff were friendly. We stayed in a 4-bed female dorm, and aside from inconsiderate roommates the first night, everything went well. The mattresses were so comfortable and were greatly appreciated after walking around the city all day. We took lyfts to and from the hostel after the first night because we didn't feel safe walking very far in the area.

I would like to give a warning to Solofemale travelers who are planning to walk to the hostel. Don't walk along Ellis street to get there, especially late afternoon/evening. If you're coming from BART or the ferry building, take Market to Larkin until you reach Ellis. Google maps gave us the quickest route, which had us walk along Ellis. If I'd been more familiar with the area, I would have taken a different route.",2/18/2019,3,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Excellent Hostel in SF,"The hostel is the best I've been in. Friendly staff.
The free breakfast is just some bread, some cheese and coffee or tea. Oh, ad I forgot - there is also peanut butter ad jam... Adding a 1$ will give you either 4 eggs or 4 pancakes.
The room is comfy, very clean. Unfortunately we were right next to the elevator and the walls are not sound proof...

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Terrible Treatment from Staff,"Myself and a friend of mine stayed at the City Center hostel recently, January 21st through the 24th, 2018 (3 nights) and while everything was okay with the room we stayed in, we had a major issue with the staff through the entirety of our stay there.

Every encounter that we had with a staff member (except for one guy who was at the desk a Couple of times, I don’t know his name) were incredibly rude and standoffish to us, which left us feeling incredibly uncomfortable through the entirety of our stay, as the treatment was enough that we anticipated walking down past the desk throughout the day as we worried about having to have interactions with the rude staff at the desk.

This began as early as check-in, when the man who checked us in was very cold and rude to us. It proceeded with another woman who was at the desk each day, who was very rude to my friend when she asked about using a hairdryer one day, and then another day said some rude things to her about my service animal.

On two occasions, we overheard this woman gossiping about us after we walked by the desk and up the stairs, when both my friend and I were nothing but kind to everyone at the front desk, until we began seeing the pattern in treatment.

While the accommodations were fine, the level to which we felt impacted by the behavior and treatment from multiple people at the front desk made our stay at the hostel absolutely terrible. When you’re paying a good amount of money per night to stay at a place, the last thing a person wants is to be made to feel like they’re a burden or mistreated when they’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.

Being on the receiving end of this treatment from the staff left us feeling so uncomfortable that we dreaded having to return to the hostel or have any interaction with the staff, not knowing if they’d be rude and act like normal questions where a huge issue, or if we’d over hear them gossiping about us after we walked by.

As paying guests of the hostel, this is treatment no guest should ever experience.

I would never recommend this hostel to anyone, unless they want to be made to feel unwelcome at their own accommodations they're paying for. I would rather stay at a crappy hotel with friendly front desk staff who you don't have to worry about gossiping about you while you're steps away than stay at this place.",1/18/2019,1,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Amazing location,"Stay here if you want to be in the centre of everything San Fran has to offer. Great rooms and really helpful staff. There are also plenty of spaces to spend time outside of your room. Computer room, theatre room, lounge and kitchen. Wifi is fast. The only downfall was that one of our group is anaphylactic but the hostel didn’t want to remove the peanut butter from kitchen temporarily.
If that isn’t an issue for you then definitely consider staying here",12/17/2019,4,Friends

I had to pay 3$ for each night because i didn't join the HI Hostel membership, idk why i have to pay for not joining or signing for a membership, kinda weird didn't experience that in any other Hostel.

Bathrooms are kind narrow, 1 shared bathroom for rooms of 4.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Surprised how good an hostel is…,"My 31 year old daughter booked into the hostel due to the price of the hotels in San Francisco..and asked me to join her...at 58..!
The hostel was better than some of the 3* hotels I have stayed in. The staff were great and very helpful and friendly.
The rooms although basic were clean, comfortable and roomy. The WiFi was good and free...the bar was nice and reasonably priced. Breakfast was free which consisted of bagels and jam..which was nice to eat with other travellers..I didn't even mind washing up.! The hostel is near bus stops to get around to all the tourist spots , the bridge, fisherman's wharf and union square.
As mentioned by others the area is pretty dismal due to the state of the buildings and the number of homeless wandering nearby...we were a bit worried about staying..but after day one and keeping away from the back streets as advised it wasn't that bad. In fact left feeling sorry for the homeless ...and actually after speaking to a few of them they were quite friendly..although saying this you obviously need to be careful. 
After spending 5 nice days..seeing the sites..the golden gate bridge is amazing..and my daughter run the San Francisco marathon...the hostel was a good choice at a good price.",11/17/2019,4,Family

San Francisco City Center Hostel,An experience,"We recently stayed at the San Francisco HI hostel and definitely had an adventure.
Firstly, as more reviews suggest, the area is pretty seedy. Just like Simba was warned by his father about the Elephant Graveyard, we were warned about what we called the ‘Triangle’. Unfortunately, just like those famous lions, we stumbled in and it made for a very intense walk home. We were shaken to a point that we looked for other options, however we were happy that we stuck it out.
We weren’t sure about the hostel at first and were expecting the worst however our room exceeded our expectations by a mile! It was incredibly clean. The hostel has some really wild rules about not eating in your room etc which was a bit annoying but we can understand why.
The staff were nice but we had a mixed bag of encounters. We felt uncomfortable the first night when one of our cards didn’t work. We had been chilling in the common area and weren’t carrying ID. We felt like we were an inconvenience to the person who served us, who was probably in the middle of a jam session. Tip: don’t put the card next to your phone! For the rest of the time everyone was easy.
Breakfast was great and you can’t go wrong with a massive serve of pancakes for one dollar! 
We may recommend this to other people but depends on what you want from your stay.",11/17/2019,4,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,A nice hostel,"I stayed in this hostel for three nights. The decor in the hostel is beautiful and the staff were very friendly and were happy to help with directions or things to do. I would recommend this hostel to people on a budget staying in San Francisco. The area is not for everyone as it is in a district known for its high homelessness, but my friend and I found that for two young females, we were both fine and we weren't approached by anyone. I wouldn't recommend walking around at night time though.",12/16/2019,4,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Acceptable Hostel but Horrible and Insecure neighborhood,"The hostel is acceptable. Most of the employees are kind and the cleaness is excelent but the hostel is located in the worst area (and street). It is full of homeless which are doing their stuffs, selling drugs and using the street as a bathroom. I was there by myself and at 7pm (when the sun goes), I locked into the hostel so I couldnt have too much social night activities because I was scared.",9/17/2019,2,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Not overly cheap for a dorm.,"Thumbs down:
I had a 4 bed female dorm. The room was cramped, 2 bunks and little floor space.
The room was dearer than I expected. It was over $50 with tax for 1 night.
The local area appeared to ropey. I wasn't sure it was overly safe.
Bathroom in the room - noisy when flushing in the night time.

Thumbs up:
There was a locker in each room for a large bag / valuables - but space was tight for luggage if not in the locker. My case didn't fit in it so it took up a lot of room.
Towel and clean bedding provided.
Breakfast included - but nothing for those checking out early like myself.
Night lights and sockets by each bunk.
Good wifi.
Big kitchen.
Free tea / coffee. 

I only stayed for roughly 6-7hrs as I was leaving for the bus station at 4am. This was just a cheaper option that getting a room in the city by myself. However, it was still dear enough for a small dorm.",8/17/2019,3,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Clean...but that's it.,"I've stayed in quite a few hostels across the world and this has to be the most poorly equipped. 

Firstly, it's located in California and there is no air conditioning throughout the entire establishment. I spent my 2 nights here sweating profusely and completely uncomfortable. I understand Northern California tends to be cooler but this weekend (labour day) has been the hottest for a while and the hostel wasn't prepared at all. The heat was inescapable. 

Secondly, the area is so intimidating and unfortunately we had no prior warning from staff like other guests seem to have gotten. The (quite rude) girl at reception couldn't get rid of us quick enough. She seemed completely annoyed by our presence and didn't seem to want to give us the time of day. This is something we experienced with both females and the 2 males working. They gave off an attitude of ""we're better than you"" and it's very off putting to say the least. And they all seemed preoccupied with their social media on the computers which isn't very welcoming. 

Thirdly, the kitchen. A very clean kitchen but lacking in basics like mixing bowls or even a freezer. The heat in the kitchen was hard to stick and it meant we ate out more than we would've liked. 

The decorations throughout the hostel, yes, beautiful and it's clear a lot of thought went into them but it seems it hasn't gone elsewhere. I won't be staying here again and it's put a sour taste in my mouth about San Francisco. 

The hostelling international we stayed at in San Diego was much more friendly, better equipped and cheaper. Having paid more I was expecting more but with the amount of money I paid here and what I received, I feel cheated.",9/17/2019,2,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Affordable & good location for walking,"If you're looking for cheap & friendly accommodation this is the place to be. Yes it's a hostel so you'll likely have to share a room but it's affordable and there are ample social activities.

The hostel includes bagels for breakfast which are complimentary. There are activities each day if you're interested as well.

It's about 15 minutes walk to union square shops, and 30 minutes to fisherman's wharf. There are lots of homeless people around but for the price you pay it's worthwhile.",8/17/2019,5,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Presently surprised,This is my first time staying in a hostile and I'm presently surprised. This place has a super funky feeling.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Clean value for money hostel, location to be aware of though.","Very clean hostel, I'm not the hostel type however my partner and I had a private room with ensuite here due to the expensive accommodation in San Fran and it was surprising clean and spacious. It was a fairly loud location and the room we found quiet hot without much option but to leave the window open. I would warn travelers about its location however, with ALOT of homeless and mentally ill people on the surrounding streets being a mission area. I was instantly anxious and felt uneasy the whole stay and it meant we didn't walk to many places unfortunately and took Uber instead due to this. The hostel staff do warn you on a arrival, however had we have known earlier I don't think we would have stayed here purely due to the area. It definitely put a dampener on San Fran for us.",7/17/2019,3,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Beautifully unique,"Ok, let's start by saying that you are probably staying in THE dodgiest spot in San Francisco. So if walking from the station to the hostel it may feel as if you're walking the gauntlet.
But stepping through the door of the hostel, is like stepping into an oasis.
What a beautiful spot. Clean, great vibe, uniquely and beautifully decorated.
Several open areas to just sit and enjoy, reading books, catching up on work, playing board games. Their bar area is also great to have a few drinks and plan your next day's activities. 
They also have a board where they write up daily activities arranged by themselves our external vendors.
Our first stay in a hostel and so glad we chose HI San Fran. We had our own private room with private bathroom. Small but clean and adequate. Enough storage space.
Kitchen can get a bit crazy in the mornings, but to be expected and nothing you can't work around. You're also free to store any items in their fridge which was handy.
Staff are really friendly.
I say the area is dodgy, but we were still able to walk to nearby restaurants in the early evening and it was fine. It is also within comfortable walking distance to Union Square to catch a tram or for shopping. Bus stops also close by for local transport.",8/17/2019,5,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,pretty perfect!,"I stayed at this hostel as a Solotraveller for two nights and found everything to be very clean, the building itself is beautiful and the (underused) kitchen is great! The 24 hour coffee was a lifesaver as were the bagels and fruit at breakfast, eggs and pancakes cooked to order looked delish as well. Personally I found the location to be perfect - as a 19yo Solofemale traveller I felt this neighbourhood was no more dangerous than any other, just more crowded and after I met a few local folk to go adventuring with we had no trouble walking the streets at night and well into the early morning. I am not afraid of homeless people as many other reviewers seem to be - I found the TL to be a friendly albeit kinda smelly place. The only people I had issues with were other tourists (not at the hostel though! v good vibes there!). The staff were really friendly and the 24hr reception was an essential perk. (they also sell stamps and post letters) 
Something to note is that there are no bathrooms (that I could find) aside from an accessible toilet in the lobby and the ensuites in every room which could be disruptive to roommates if you were showering while others were sleeping but hey, that's the hostel life!
Loved my stay, cannot wait to be back in SF!

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great first hostel experience!,"A wife and mother of ""mature age"", I was traveling Solothis trip and decided to try hosteling for the first time. My son stayed here for 2 weeks in May, along with his 8th grade class, on an experiential ed trip, as they have done for several years. 
I stayed in a mixed 4-person dorm with 2 bunk beds in a fair-sized room and ensuite bathroom, on the second floor. Check-in was seamless as I had a reservation and thank goodness as they were booked on this busy weekend. $60 plus tax and a $3 fee since I was not a member of Hosteling International. The rules were well-laid out (no food or personal bed linens in room, must show pass when entering building). I was assigned a bunk and locker number. This is in a funky old building on the fringes of the Tenderloin neighborhood. The room was safe and clean, you had to use your key card to enter. Bed and bath linens were clean and sufficient. Make your own bed. Nice original tiled bathroom. Several communal lounging areas including a great mezzanine on the second floor with computers and charging stations. Free wifi. Giant very efficient kitchen with plenty of space and appliances to make your own meals. My roomates didn't appear until the middle of the night but were very respectful of the hour and settled in quietly. We had the windows cracked for fresh air so heard some city noises like shouting and cars roaring in the night but, well, it's the city! Breakfast was casual with bagels and bread for toasting, spreads, milk, fruit, juices and instant oatmeal. I had my own tea and they had hot water for that. Wash your own dishes and place them in the rack to be sanitized by staff. They let me leave my luggage all afternoon after checking out. It's kept in a locked room and you attach a claim ticket.
Note about parking. The Cova Hotel valet 2 doors down will allow hostel guests to park there. It isn't cheap. My car was there for 28 hours and it cost $47. However, I didn't worry about my vehicle being safe, it was close by and city parking is difficult, so I expected as much. 
This was the first time I ever stayed in a hostel. It'd not just for young folks! I met several other travelers and had interesting conversations. I would love to stay here again sometime!",6/17/2019,5,Solo

San Francisco City Center Hostel,School trip to San Francisco,"Went here 2 months ago on a silicon Valley school trip. Before you go: the hostel is located in the Tenderloin, a rough neigbourhood. With that said I think it's the perfect hotel to explore San Francisco. Good location, great restaurants/bars in the area and you get to know the real SF, not just the tourist parts. The hostel is fine, the mattresses were not so great, we had some problems with the water and the heating was on 24/7 and we couldn't close the heater. Breakfast is basic, very basic but for just 1 dollar you get scrambled eggs or pancakes.

The staff are pleasant and go out of their way to help you. 

Breakfast is very basic, but there are a great deal of options nearby. The community feel in the hotel is great, and in the evenings it feels very active.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great Hostel,"Whilst in the US for two weeks in Vegas we decided to break up the stay by visiting San Francisco.

The staff at check in were really friendly and helpful.

We booked the twin private room which was on the 5th floor and it was brilliant, better than some hotels I have stayed in. There is an elevator. The room was really clean, light and airy. The beds were super comfortable. Being in a big city we thought it would be really noisy but we slept like logs. Breakfast was included in the price, it was basic (bagels, toast, fruit etc) but you can pay a $1or pancakes (the size of your head) or eggs. There is plenty of communal space to sit and relax and the breakfast area doubles up as a bar in the evening. 

The location is good and not too far from the main tourist areas. We got a cab back from Fishermans Wharf and it was only around $15.However, Ellis Street is not the best. There are lots of homeless people which is pretty much the same as in every big city and it does have a distinct smell.

Had the best night sleeps! Location wise it is technically in the tenderloin which is known for a high level of tourists, but it is central enough that you can uber anywhere for a few dollars.

Decent budget accommodation for the social types","I stayed here for a Couple of nights in Feb 2017 when I tacked a weekend stay onto the end of a work trip.

Although there is a beautiful old elevator (complete with sliding grate door), it was a bit slow for my tastes, so I used the stairs (good bit of exercise too).

The shared areas were fine. Lots of table, chairs in various nooks and crannies, where you can get some work done, or chat to new-found friend. 

The included breakfast was basically toast, with jam and peanut butter. Coffee was ok.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great Stay at Hostel International City Centre,"I stayed at the City Centre hostel with 2 colleagues and 22 students during an educational visit in Feb 2017.

The rooms were cleaned everyday and all our bedding was clean. Breakfast was good, bagels, cereal, juice, fruit and an extra $1 for pancakes (4) or eggs is a bargain. The kitchen has plenty of space to store food/drinks and there is a mini-mart next door to the hostel. The bar was open in the evening with very reasonable prices for beer/wine compared to most places in SF. One of my colleagues was particularly nervous about staying in a hostel for the first time. However, she was pleasantly surprised and declared Hostel International City Centre better than many hotels she had stayed in. Would I take a group there again..yes most definitely. 

Ok, Ellis Street is not the best (there are homeless people around but that is the same in nearly every city anywhere these days. Hopefully the city hall can help these people move off the streets into accommodation in the future).

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Single room sort of like at a hotel,"Based on a 3-night weekend stay:

PROS
Economical option for convenient central city location.
Nice single room: clean, comfortable, uncluttered, tasteful décor, with own bathroom, full bed, desk, reading chair, decent lighting, closet, window, solid door lock. 
Room safe in closet (small extra charge/day).
Pleasant, comfy lobby/lounge and common areas; big, clean kitchen with frigs for food storage; amenities provided such as coffee/tea; continental breakfast; good wifi.
& a bar downstairs!
Surprisingly quiet in room (mine was on the 3rd floor, overlooking an alley).
Helpful front desk staff.

CONS
Water not reliably hot in shower; pressure sometimes too low.
Heat on only at night (even during a cold, rainy day in December).
Room sometimes had a bit of a bad odor.
Neighborhood sketchy (not especially unsafe, but not pleasant, either).

YOU MIGHT CARE TO KNOW:
Room use restricted (no visitors, no food, etc.).
No tv, hair drier, etc. (It’s not a hotel room, after all.)
Atmosphere is throwback 70s funky.
Common areas/hallways can be busy, noisy, crowded.

WARNING: IF you previously lived in SF and you didn’t pay to replace your driver’s license when you changed your address with the DMV, you might not be able to stay. I included a note with my reservation explaining that I’d moved 2 ½ years ago. I also brought two government issued picture IDs along with a recent vehicle registration bill from the DMV, figuring the IDs proved who I was and the bill proved that my official address with the DMV was outside of SF now. But, still, I was only allowed to register because a manager allowed an exception. At another time, who knows?

The area surrounding the hostel is dangerous for walking, especially for the women. I was walking with my friend, and a strange man was stalking. As I was in, he was peeping inside to see where I was going.  When I saw the same man stalking me the next day, I asked the staff if I could make a police complaint. Instead of helping me, she made unkind remarks on my clothes, and said that  if I dressed 'provocative' I would be stalked.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,Horrible staff,"I really spent a lot of time looking for a nice accommodation in SFO for a few days and think I've nailed it.
Unfortunately it is a joke and I want to explain why. It's completely useless making comments on the location as is well known that Tenderloin is unfortunately the worst neighborhood in town, however I have chosen the City Center Hostel based on the reviews.
Unfortunately the only thing I can save about the Hostel is the building (really cool) and the cleanliness.
As soon as we arrived about 11.00 pm we felt unwelcome by the staff, not a smile or a sigle help with all our bags, actually they seemed quite annoyed about our questions.
Fair enough, second day even worst. My best friend who's leaving in SFO wanted to pass by to say hello but they don't even allow him to stay in the hall as it's stated in policy and better to avoid the rudeness of one of them asking my wife the card of the Hostel.
In other words we payed the same fare of an Hotel but treated like kids from a bunch of kids.
Considering the neighborhood they are located and the fares they have they should definitely more customers oriented.

Door to the bathroom only just opened past the bed. Also no TV in the room, which I understand might be the norm for hostels but I have stayed in 5 or 6 other private rooms in different hostels and they have all had TVs.

Free breakfast was great, fresh bread and bagels and for just $1 you could get eggs or pancakes. Plus juice, tea, coffee etc. 

Location wasn't very good but you expect that going in. There was a LOT of noise during the night from outside - yelling, car alarms, sirens etc so it's not the most restful stay. I wouldnt walk around the area by myself but I was with my fiance so felt safe enough and people on the street might say something to you but then leave you alone. You also feel safe once you get inside the hostel.

Was walking distance to Geary street which leads to Union Square in 10-15 minutes so it's only a couple of blocks of not very nice streets before you get to the good stuff. It's also easy to catch an Uber.

The staff are friendly and informative and the place has a really great vibe. The bedrooms are very clean and the beds extraordinarily comfy, which makes for a really great nights sleep. There is some noise from outside but there's always going to be as you're in the heart of a big city and you're staying in an old building. The noise wasn't an issue for me and certainly didn't disturb my sleep! 
The breakfasts here are wonderful. There are an abundance of bagels, bread/toast, tea and coffee and juice and for a dollar you can have a mountain of American pancakes or eggs any which way you'd like them.

The building is amazing and very well kept. Centrally located and easily accesible is definately a must go when you are planning a trip to SF.
Molly, the manager, is one if the nicest people you'll ever meet!
Really an enjoyable experience!",11/1/2016,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Awesome spot to stay in the city,"Fantastic hostel with eye-popping, bonkers decor (in the best way). You can see how much the people who work there care about their work, the guests' experiences and the surrounding neighborhood, which is definitely rough around the edges, but I found it to be all bark, no bite. There's a beer and wine bar inside the hostel (only open to guests though). Great bar, Emperor Norton's, right around the corner. Polk Street nearby had a ton of nightlife as well, and there's a bunch of great Vietnamese joints in the neighborhood. Staff were awesome, bagels at breakfast were really good, location in city center made it easy to get anywhere pretty fast. Will definitely book again.",10/1/2016,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great home base for a weekend in the city!,"This was my first time in SF, so I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I have only good things to say about the HI City Center. The hostel was easy enough to get to from the airport, just a 10 minute walk from Civic Center station on the bart. Uber pool here also seems to be cheaper than most other cities, so I relied on that a bit given the neighborhood the hostel is located in. The part of town isn't the greatest but even traveling by myself I never did feel unsafe--everyone keeps mostly to themselves and there's often a security presence nearby. 

Check in staff was friendly and hospitable; they explained the layout of the hoste and offered directions and bag holding, but I was lucky enough to be able to check in early. The private room and bathroom were spacious, clean, tasteful, and went far beyond what I expect from a hostel. 

Free breakfast downstairs in the morning- bagels, toast, oatmeal, juice (or 1$ eggs/pancakes) was a winner, and the bar in the lobby served as a better place to start the night than most bars around - Cash only but there's an atm around the corner. The free coffee is served I think at all hours, and is also very good.

I'll definitely be coming back to stay with HI City Center again!",10/1/2016,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Nice homey feel in the city,"Downtown hostel in a not so great area..lots of homeless around outside. However, door security and once inside wonderfully warm and hospitable. Felt safe, rooms clean tidy and we'll maintained, lovely communal lounge areas and a bar inside of hostel.
Great staff and really cheap for San fran, my friend and I stayed in a 4 bed female dorm for 3 nights was great private bathroom. Good mix of guests from 20 something travellers to mature business people intown for local conferences. Regular visitors, movies and free meals (nominal charge eg pasta tuesday..a one dollar charge for evening pasta meal! )
Great if ur on a budget! For all ages only draw back if any is there is no inhouse laundry",10/1/2016,5,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Amazing trendy hostel at a great price!,"I have stayed at HI City center a handful of times when I visit san francisco and am always surprised by how incredible it is for the price. It remains one of the cheapest hostels in SF while still offering incredible service and amenities. This last trip I stayed in a private room for the first time and it was on par with staying in a hotel. The decor gives it a great vibe, the staff is always super friendly, there's free breakfast and just for a buck you can add eggs or pancakes! It has an awesome bar attached to it with some of the cheapest prices of beer you'll find around. I will always go to City Center when I visit SF. I highly recommend this place!!",10/1/2016,5,Family

San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Great Hostel, dodgy area!","My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights. The stay there was started off on a high, as when booked our stay, we wanted a little fun and requested that they put a funny photo of Nicholas Cage on the bed for us for a laugh. They not only put the photo on the bed, but scattered 5 other photos around the room! This kind of staff commitment always makes for an awesome stay wherever you are

Pros: 
The rooms were nice and simple (the way I like it) and the bed were so comfy! 
The free inclusive breakfast was great for someone on budget 
The staff were super friendly 
The hostel was aways popping and had something going on
The whole building was just designed and decorated awesomely! 
The location, even though maybe not in the nicest location was central to everything and just a 10-15 minute uber ride everywhere you would want to go! 

Cons:
As I said before, it's not in the nicest location. But be that as it may, it's not a problem unless you put yourself in harms way. Like there isn't anything touristy around the hostel so why be out there past a certain time? Just stick to the immediate block for food purposes or go somewhere else for dinner and drinks then get dropped off right at the door. Simple! 
People also said the noise outside was making it hard to sleep. Well get over it because your staying in the middle of a highly populated city. It's going to be loud 24/7. 

All in all I really enjoyed my stay here! Keep up the good work guys!",10/1/2016,5,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,Great hostel. Bad area.,"The hostel is 4 stars. It's adorably decorated, clean, and the staff is great. The 2 bunk bed room I stayed in was a tight fit but luckily my roommates and I were on different schedules for arriving, leaving, getting ready, etc. 

As other reviews have said, the area is rough. I came prepared as I'd visited SF before so I was aware of the homeless population. I saw drug deals, people carrying around their crack pipe, and people yelling and talking to themselves. At times I had to weave my way around homeless people clogging the sidewalk and step over puddles of urine. 

In the end, I saved a lot of money staying here. I was never stopped or asked for anything by any of the people living on the street around the hostel. I went out alone during the day and at dinner time and walked around the area. I took an Uber after dark. The House of Thai two blocks up was delicious and reasonably priced. It was worth staying here for this trip but I don't think I'd return.",10/1/2016,3,Solo

Great hostel in the centre of San Francisco","We had a fantastic stay at the hostel and we’d recommend staying there. It’s a beautiful building, full of character. Our room and en-suite bathroom were spacious and very clean, and we had views of downtown San Francisco from the window. 

The hostel staff were very helpful and friendly with extensive knowledge of the city. The hostel is very centrally located - we walked all over the city from there. There are some great restaurants nearby, including Rusty’s Southern.

The complimentary breakfasts were generous and tasty. We went for one-dollar pancakes every day - delicious, filling and excellent value. We also very much appreciated the free tea and coffee all day.",9/1/2016,5,Couple

San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Nice Hostel, but…","Let me begin by saying that this hostel is great with quaint look and jolly atmosphere. I usually go to the downtown hostel in San Francisco, but I stayed with them for a change earlier this year. I had a very comfortable stay with them, and I had no issues with their staff or logistics. They were doing fine job. The homeless problem around is frustrating but I didn't find that a bummer personally--the dirty street, though, was. I would avoid that location. 

But let me also say that I was shocked to see their staff involved in substance and alcohol in their duty hours. Sometimes they would behave very strangely. Neither of us got into each other's hair, but I decided to avoid this hostel and Tenderloin altogether. I surmise this hostel can become a better place if it is made drug and alcohol-free. I know many people at hostelling international and I'd prefer to have my conversation with them on matters other than this review. I dont feel happy to write this review, though.",2/1/2016,3,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Good hostel, poor location","Safety of the location is of a huge concern.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,"Accommodation was good, but the area was not so safe.","The accommodation was good. The room I shared and public space was clean. I shared the room with three other room mates and they were respectful. Staff was kind and answered to many questions I asked.

The area hostel located in wasn't ghetto though, I felt the neighborhood was not so safe. I smelled strong marijuana many times as walking the street around there. I saw many homeless. They didn't beg for me aggressively.",3/1/2016,3,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"This was my first time staying in a hostel and it was a great experience. Staff were friendly upon arrival and very helpful. The group of girls I stayed in a dorm with were from my city and my age, whether this was intentional or not it was nice. Beds were very comfy and it was very clean. Had no issue with noise at all. Breakfast was great with $1 for pancakes or eggs, and you get four! Checkout was easy and they are able to hold your luggage. Wifi was great and everyone staying here was really friendly. Reception team are awesome.",8/1/2016,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I stayed here for 3 nights in June. Hostel was clean, beds were fine. The free breakfast was ok. Better than a lot of hostels I've been in anyway. 

The real highlight of the hostel was the bar. Considering San Fran is generally a really expensive city the pints were pretty cheap, especially during happy hour. The beers they had were local and very good also. 

The only hostel activity I did was the pub crawl which was great. A decent number of people were on it and all the bars were good and reasonably priced. 

It's located near some good food spots and bars on Polk street. Although it does appear to be in the middle of a bit of a hotspot for homeless people. They didn't cause any real issues but I'd definitely be a bit wary as there is a lot of 'characters' in the area.",7/1/2016,5,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"We stayed in a private double room for 3 nights. We were pleasantly surprised when we opened the door to our lovely double room.

Free breakfast is quite basic, however, for $1 you can get 4 pancakes or a plate of eggs, which is more than one usually gets at a hostel breakfast. The location is good in the sense that it's not too far from union square. However.... Just a street away, it gets a bit sketchy, with a very large population of homeless crowding the streets. Other than that, a wonderful place to stay!",8/1/2016,4,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"Basically a good hostel, but not the best of where I've been till now. The sockets in the room were not practical at all in my room at first, because I was assigned an upper bed in the bunk and the socket was low on the wall. Due to that I asked for a change in my room and had to wait 2 nights. The problem was finally solved in my next room but there the wifi was very slow and bad. Then it also happened that I wanted to enter my room and my crd suddenly stopped working, and I had to walk to the reception for them to do something. This happened twice.. annoying.
The area was not really a nice area but if you don't walk there at night you should be okay.",1/1/2016,3,Solo

We found the location no problem at all, at first it can be daunting walking down Ellis Street amongst the great number of homeless people but we were ignored by them for the most part. Easy enough to walk down alternative streets to Union Square to avoid it tho if it makes you feel uncomfortable. We walked everywhere and got a great feel for the city!",7/1/2016,5,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"This is one great hostel, very clean and nicely decorated, cool vibe throughout the hotel the staffs are friendly. Old and young are welcome in this property.

Bring your earplug and your favorite book, it is noisy outside and room got no aircon and no tv but i dont miss them at all, im out all day long. 

Please note that hotel located in bad and dingy area, homeless are everywhere. This is the first time i feel a bit unsafe walking during evening. Just be aware of your surrounding, avoid street that is too quiet or just use uber when not sure.",7/1/2016,5,Couple

The kitchen facilities were also great and the hostel provides free bagels and tea/coffee for breakfast. The only downside to the hostel is the location.

The 4 bed dorms are pretty small but clean. Breakfast is ok too.
The neighborhood is a bit shady but it didn't really bother me and I felt safe at all times.
However I found the ''no outside alcohol'' rule quite strange so one is basically forced to spend money at the bar (which is not that expensive though). Never experienced this in any other hostel.",6/1/2016,4,Solo

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I've stayed here twice, in June of 2010 and December of 2013; each time traveling alone.
In June of 2010, I stayed in a 4 bed dorm. The other beds were occupied each night. Overall, it was a better experience than I thought it would be. Although, there are a few cons: 1) Some people were coming and going in the middle of the night one night; and 2) If you're a light sleeper, you might be woken up if the person you are sharing the bunk bed with gets up during the night for any reason. Several days, during the day, I had the room to myself.
I stayed in a private room in December of 2013. I preferred it over the dorm. It is more expensive, however, but you do get a private bathroom. Private rooms do not have TV's either.
The WIFI worked well. The free breakfast is alright for being free. It includes bread and jam, juice and coffee. There is a full kitchen available for guests to use. And there are spacious common areas. The staff was friendly. The location is not bad, centrally located and near public transportation.",12/1/2015,3,Solo

Was super happy to find that my room had its own bathroom... which may have been specified when I made the reservation but... I forgot ookay, only human here ;) The beds were comfy, the rooms were cleaned daily, and the breakfast was served from 7:30 to 11:30 which was freaking awesome because seriousy who wants to get up early on vavaction!

But consider that San Francisco has a really serious problem with homelessness, and that many areas will be the same. I never felt unsafe or had any trouble walking around the neighborhood. 
The hotel itself: The room was clean, including the bathroom, floors and bedding. It was cleaned every day with fresh towels left for us. 
The front desk had various items for borrowing or purchase like an iron, hair dryer, and padlocks. They went to a lot of effort to organise activities like tours for guests, and the staff I interacted with were helpful and informative.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I stayed at the City Center Hostel on a recent trip to the USA. I found the hostel online and booked it due to its cheap price, and its location. 

The hostel itself is located in Tenderloin, which is by no means the most salubrious of locations. An Uber driver told me that it is the sort of place that tourists should not walk around at night as it was unsafe. Each morning when I left the hostel I was met by numerous homeless individuals. On the same street a few blocks away are several homeless shelters, and as such much of the street is filled with beggers, people trying to sell their belongings etc. As a substantial gentleman (5ft 11, 240lbs) I could brush this off, however this could be quite intimidating to a woman. The sight of so many people in need of help could also be found distressing. In fact on my final night around 40 volunteers checked in as they were intending to work with the homeless that week. 

Despite this however the location was useful. It was a short 10 minute walk to Union Square and the Westfield Mall. From these locations you could quite easily get public transport to other areas of the city. 

In regards to accommodation, I was in a 4 bed dorm with an en-suite. The room itself was tidy and large lockers are available to store your belongings in. My one gripe was that the bed did not have a ladder to get up to the top bunk. As someone who tore up knee ligaments within the last 12 months, I was not to keen on getting out of bed in the mornings as the bunks themselves were quite high.

Each morning there was a free continental breakfast, bread/bagels with jam. This is served in the bar area. There is a large kitchen which is available for use by the guests. In general the staff were friendly, and the building felt secure. I didn't really enjoy the bar in the evenings. The atmosphere felt a little forced. Food was permitted to be brought into the building, however alcohol consumption was not permitted unless bought at the bar.

As is standard in hostels, there was free Wi-fi and large communal areas. There were nightly activities put on by the staff and a board of local free events which was updated each morning.

Overall I enjoyed my stay, but it was not the best hostel I stayed in on my travels. For some reason, the hostel felt a little anti-social. However this does not put me off recommending it for fellow travellers.",3/1/2016,4,Solo

There is so many homeless people in this area, because it is close to Civic Center, but don't be afraid no one will hurt you, just walk normally.

With the presence of a bar at the hostel it allowed me to taste the local beers and socialize with other guests. I for one spent one evening chatting to the barman at the Hostel by the name of Arjen. I really enjoyed our conversation about soccer. He was very friendly and I found him very interesting to talk to.
All of the staff are very friendly and were always ready to help in anyway possible to ensure my stay was as enjoyable as possible.

Then she started talking to herself and littering stuff all around. Finally when she left in the morning, I found a phamplet which said, 'medical advice for the homeless', which made me shiver.

Spacious rooms by hostel standards and extremely clean en-suite bathrooms. Great common spaces and wonderful complimentary breakfast. $1 drinks at the bar --can't be beat.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"This was my second time using HI City Center as my base of operations from which to explore San Francisco, and I couldn't have been happier with my choice.

Located in the Tenderloin and within walking distance of a wealth of delciious SE Asian cuisine in nearby Little Saigon, HI City Center is a short walk or ride from virtually everything. We walked from the hostel to Golden Gate Park, through Mission & Castro, and back with relative ease.

The rooms themselves are spartan but comfortable, with comfy beds, private bathrooms, and sizeable in-room lockers. WiFi is available throughout the hostel, although it can be a bit unreliable on the higher floors. The retro elevator is slower than just climbing the steps, but I loved it.

The real charm of HI City Center comes from its friendly staff and its ground floor & mezzanine. Comfortable chairs, a projector for movie nights, tables and chairs for working, and an on-site bar make for a really fun, social vibe. My mates and I spent many an evening enjoying a few beers in the bar.

The free breakfast is a real treat as well. While the option is there to pay a little extra for eggs or pancakes, most mornings I was more than satisfied with the coffee, orange juice, and bagels (with cream cheese) on offer.

All told, HI City Center has been one of my favourite hosteling experiences. Just a fun, comfortable, and wonderfully located hostel.",2/1/2016,4,Friends

Therefore, I would not suggest this hostel for solo travellers. I would go again if I were to go with friends as my only concern was walking the surroundings (even during day time - I was followed and someone even grabbed my arm).

So bottom line - Amazing hostel, great staff, really clean. Would 100% recommend for people travelling with friends. Would advise against if travelling alone due to location.",2/1/2016,4,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I stayed at the HI City Center in San Francisco for 7 nights in January 2016 and I loved it and would absolutely stay there again if I ever come back to San Francisco! 

Staff were friendly and answered all my questions. They helped me book a tour to Yosemite and gave great info on what to do and see in the city. I had a top bunk in a four person room with en ensuite bathroom. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. It was facing a quiet parking lot. A few people came and went while I was there, all friendly and cool to talk to (one of the best parts of staying at a hostel). Breakfast was served every day and had pretty long hours, making it easy to both get up early (as for jetlaged me) or late. 

The hostel is in the Tenderloin district. I had been warned of this district before arriving and was unsure of how it would be to live there for a week, but I encountered no problems at all. There are a few homeless people on the streets, yes, but none of them really bothered me and I actually had some interesting conversations with a few of them. The location of the hostel is convenient. I could walk to a lot of places around the town and buses were close by, going in all directions. The hostel checked your hostel ID everytime you came into the hostel, making sure no one who was not supposed to be there got in. I felt safe, both in the area and in the hostel. 

The wifi in the hostel was good, both in the common areas as well as in my room. The kitchen seemed cool, but I didn't really use it, except for breakfast. 

Would defintely recommend this hostel :)",1/1/2016,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"Everything in this ""hotel"" was correct. From the free buffet to the rooms! The place is a bit noisy but not really bothering to sleep. The staff is friendly and helpful and the inside bar is a good and cheap place to rest after a long walking day and to begin the night (4$ a beer, that's nice!)
The hotel is in the heart of the city, but the area is bad, better be careful !",1/1/2016,4,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I stayed at Hi Hostel for 2 nights before New Years. It is located in the Tenderloin which I found to be a shady hood but had absolutely no problems at all while walking on my way back as a single girl in the night 10-11pm. Just keep walking, keep your eyes open and don't talk to anyone. Otherwise the hostel is less than 10min walk from Union Square. 
I stayed in a 4 bed female dorm - 2 bunk beds and shower/bathroom for share between the 4 roommates. Cost at that time was about 80$ for the 2 nights. Clean linen and they gave a towel which was super nice. Everyone gets a locker but no lock so bring your own (experienced packers would know that!) There is a bar downstairs and it accepts only cash but drinks are super good deal (beer and wine only unfortunately). Staff was friendly enough but definitely looked bored and disinterested. 
Breakfast is free - nothing special really but for 1$ extra you get either eggs or pancakes so for 2$ you get both. Problem was the guy who cooks them starts after 8.30am. 
The hostel is super huge, used to be a hotel and it still looks like one except it's budget. Overall I liked my experience there. Message if you have questions.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"The HI Hostel in central SF was a great stay, but we found it a bit pricey (with its hidden non-member extra charges) and in a pretty rough location, right on the edge of the Tenderloin, and not particularly close to any of SF's main attractions.

The hostel security was not bad - you had to flash your guest card to the reception on your way in and needed a keycard to access your room, however we noticed the odd homeless local wandered in to hassle the reception.

The staff were friendly enough but one or two seemed a little uninterested. Atmosphere was pretty good, while we were there they had a local soul group playing music in the common area which was good fun. The bar was also lively and reasonably priced.

The hostel was very clean, both in the rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast was good and the hostel had good facilities including the use of a fully equipped kitchen. Wifi, however, was quite slow.

Overall, HI was reasonable value for money and I would stay here again, in the knowledge that it's a short bus or taxi ride from most of the city's attractions and amenities.",9/1/2015,4,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"This hostel was AWESOME! I am from Aus and this was the first place where My fiend and I stayed. The pictures show exactly what you are getting, which is a lovely, quaint hostel! We had a private room, which had a great comfy bed. The shower and toilet were small, but that was a small minor! 

People will tell you that the area (street) is horrible with a lot of homeless people. This is true, but they are harmless and the hostel is safe. The only issue is that you can hear them all night long on the streets, but just wear ear plugs!

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I am from the area but having been living out of the country for a number of years. I returned from a 2 week visit to Roseville and San Francisco and of the two hostels I booked Hostels International City Center was the one I would return to with pleasure It was not on my list but needed a bed for 2 nights and others were full so finding HI City Center was a happy ""accidental"" find. I reserved 2 days and enjoyed the atmosphere so much that I extended for a week. 
The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the public rooms were like a a boutique hotel with great homey design, in each room. A bar, cafe area was a real bar with $4 craft beer, free breakfasts, and a large restaurant style kitchen where one could cook or place orders at breakfast. Cooked eggs were $1 for 4 eggs prepared to your liking. On Tuesday evening there was a pasta dinner as a fundraiser for a local charity for $1. 
My large dorm room had 4 beds, and bathroom/tub and shower in the room, with bright bay windows. The room and all the facilities were spotless, towels and mats were changed when the room was cleaned daily. Free WiFi accessible in each room of the 7 story hostel. The other guests were primarily foreigner so we all had a good time talking about our various destinations and travel history. I doubt I have had such a comfortable home like stay in hotel or hostel anywhere before, The mattresses were new and of a type I had not felt before; memory foam inner core, that resulted in some of the best sleeps I have had in a long time. The room was quiet, and even the bathroom was sound isolated from the sleeping room.
The only potential detraction for someone not familiar with US cities was the location, while close to the heart of downtown, is also where a lot of homeless people are sleeping on the streets. Ellis Street is in the middle of the Tenderloin, just a couple blocks from the major shopping district, BART, easy transportation but don't be surprised to see a dozen people sleeping on the street when approaching by foot. No problems were expected or experienced but many foreign visitors might be intimidated.
I am late to the hostel scene, having used apartments and hotels in most of my travels all over the world but this week stay added so much to my return visit o San Francisco, I will seek out hostels in other regions but if in San Francisco, I am happy to have found a ""home"" away from home.",11/1/2015,5,Solo

The street we walked through was pretty bad and even some cops stopped and asked us what we were doing there, and told us to get out of there asap. Once we reached the hostel they confirmed that we picked a very bad part to walk through but that the other streets are ok. You basically have to avoid the blocks between the train station and the hostel.

The hostel itself is really nice, great staff, great breakfast with 1 dollar eggs and pancakes, the bar is fun to go for a drink before going to bed. We had a private room, very comfortable, small bathroom but we had everything we needed.

Really enjoyed our stay there but we wish we would have known about the area being not so nice (on trip advisor I didn't read any comments about this when I booked the hostel a few months ago, but now I notice more comments like mine in the more recent ones) and we would have taken an Ubertaxi from the airport.

The only negative thing I have to say is that we felt a bit unsafe because of where the hostel is located. It's not the prettiest part of San Fran to stay in and you can be bombarded with weirdo's as soon as you leave, however, if you just head down the road and catch the bus to the pier you'll be fine! I just wish I had known about the area a bit more before booking and I think a number of young girls would probably feel the same.

They were absolutely the best! I went to the front desk several times with questions on how to get to various places in the city. I'm sure they hear the same questions day after day but they were always extremely friendly, patient, and helpful. They advised me to think about getting a three-day Muni pass, which I did. I rode the busses and cable cars everywhere and it saved me a lot of money. The free breakfast was unexpected and very nice. The room was cleaned and I had fresh linens and a towel every day. Again, an unexpected perk.

I also loved the building. The kitchen was huge and very well-equipped. The common areas were decorated in a very interesting and eclectic manner and there were so many little ""nooks and crannies"" to relax in. It was cozy (see photos). I would love to stay here again and if I ever get the chance to go back to San Francisco I will! 

On the neighborhood: It's hard to ignore the fact that there are a LOT of homeless people in the Tenderloin. Those who went about screaming were a bit disconcerting, but none of them accosted me and I really didn't feel unsafe there during the day. I didn't go out much at night. It made me sad to see so many people in such dire straits.",9/1/2015,5,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"Pros:

Cheap! Paid <$30 per night for an en suite 4 bedroom female dorm. Adding to that, breakfast is free (although limited and repetitive) and it's in the middle of town so everything was a short walk away. Space is sufficient and furnishings are tasteful. No problems with WiFi. Our bathroom was cleaned once a day. People and staff are friendly. 

Caveats: 

Do bring earplugs as always as people will do things at random times. They're also free at the front desk if you forget yours.

This area (Ellis St. and the two streets below it) is full of homeless people. One staff member told me she would detour to the streets above when walking to work even during the day. I would encourage you to do the same, especially if you plan to return late (not the best idea).",12/1/2014,4,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"We stayed here for a week in August. Arriving from the airport on the BART we emerged from the station into a square with beggars and vagrants all around us. The walk up from the station was an education - streets full of unfortunate people -some drunk or otherwise out of it and some just dancing to the music inside their heads. There was a portable toilet with a security guard and the pavements smelt of urine. I have never seen anywhere in the developed world with so many people lying on the streets.

The people at the hostel directed us towards others areas but, in the end, the shortest way to all the central bits of SF is via Tenderloin and we walked up and down the road every day that we were there. Leaflets from the Hostel tell you that the people are distressing but not dangerous and that was certainly our experience; we were never accosted or felt threatened but it was a squalid part of every day.

The hostel itself is great with good social areas and a programme of events; the staff were helpful and knowledgeable. It is undoubtedly central.

On the way back to the BART station on our last day my 9 year old tripped over and landed in a gutter full of foul smelling water; I shudder to think what was in it and we poured bottled water over his open wounds and paid $15 for a shower at the airport, poor child.

One guy at the front desk picks it and he couldn't care less if anyone else wants to hear it. For that reason, I wouldn't stay here again, as I want to be able to talk to people or focus on something online and if one person's music preferences mean everyone else has to sit through it all day, then it's not really fit to host a lot of different people.

Let's face it - the ""Tenderloin"" section of the city has a lot of homeless - but folks should realize that this unique, historic section is safe and fascinating. There are neighborhood tours that will help visitors understand the history of these old streets. Understand that the city has purchased many apartment building and old hotels in the area to provide housing for the needy. These units don't have kitchens and the streets really are their ""front porch"". So while many might feel a bit uncomfortable, it really was not unsafe or unpleasant. In fact, if you just get to know folks a little bit you'll find they are lovely. My sister and I traveled these streets at all hours and did not feel threatened. The staff at the Hostel were great - they have lots of activities right there. They offer great advice and DISCOUNTS! Wonderful breakfast too. We also learned about volunteering at the GLIDE center just down the street so we helped serve breakfast one morning. That was one of the highlights of our trip!

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I clearly hadn't done my research before coming to San Francisco. I'd just left Utah, hopped on a place, spent the whole day travelling, and eventually arrived in downtown San Fran in need of rest and some quiet time.

Unluckily for me, I'd chosen to arrive at the exact same time as the Pride Celebrations had started. Don't get me wrong, it looked like one hell of a party, but with all my gear on my back, and bleary eyes, I was pining for bed.

Thankfully, the SF City Centre Hostel had just that waiting for me, and from the moment I walked in, and left behind the chaos (fabulous chaos, though) outside, I was impressed.

The place is nice, no doubt about it. The rooms are comfy, quiet, and there's plenty of them. They've got social events, free breakfast, a mint kitchen, cheap dinners, themed nights, and the guests are generally cool people.

What I didn't so much like was the area. After my first night, I assumed the area was a bit scummy on account of the celebrations the day prior. But it didn't get better. It's not a safe area, but not just that, it's kind of gross. Homelessness is rife all around this place, and - even as a mid-twenties male, walking around just didn't feel safe. The homeless in the area are probably harmless, but I'd rather not take the risk.

The en suite rooms were clean and spacious, with plenty of plus for phone charging and the likes!
Breakfast was very good with your choice of bagels, bread, porridge and all sorts of spreads. A dollar extra gets you a pancakes or eggs - definitely recommend them.

The location is right in the middle of the Tenderloin area. DO NOT walk around after dusk. The homeless situation and drug abuse is clearly evident.

The room was tidy (I was in a female 4 bed dorm with en-suite), not too spacious but there are plenty of areas within the hostel to sit and lots to do in San Fran so you don't need to stay in your room. I stayed for 5 nights and slept well.

The hostel puts on some really good nights and organises trips to bars etc. I particularly enjoyed the Mexican night with singers and mexican food. 

Breakfast was always good and kitchen area always clean and tidy.

The only downside I can think of is that there are a lot of students in the hostel that already know each other so possibly not the best if you're looking to socialise.

Public transportation was only a short way from the hostel. You could get anywhere with the bus (day ticket only $2.25).

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"H.I. City Center is one of the most customer friendly places I have ever seen! After staying in the Boston International Hostel last year and being impressed with the economy, cleanliness, and location my fiancé and I decided to look up the same for our vacation in San Fran. We think Hosteling is the best way to travel. Our pick of the City Center was based on its central location as well as its economy. Upon arriving I was very pleasantly surprised at how stylish it is. It is a well-kept older building that still has the original 1930’s or 40’s retro charm but it does not feel old. It is in Tenderloin district which has a bad rep and that might be deserved but, like all big cities, you can easily get around “bad” areas. There is a Homeless Mission nearby (and H.I. had volunteer opportunities posted) and that is why there is a prevalence of homeless nearby. We were told easy ways to get around this area and it was no problem. We never felt threatened wherever we walked. Or you can just take a cab or bus to avoid walking in this “bad” area. We actually walked from little Italy through China town to City Center around 11 PM and had no problems and it gave us a real feel for San Fran’s hilly streets, and they are as hilly as people describe. H.I. City Center offers a free coffee/juice/toast/bagel breakfast where you add $1.00 and can get four eggs OR pancakes, that is a deal! The little bar/pub attached is charming and a great place to meet new people from all over the world. We found it to be a convenient and mellow place to unwind after a long day of being a tourist. H.I. City Center is clean, economical, but MOSTLY the customer service is beyond reproach. Everyone who works there is informed and they actively look to be helpful. We had a problem trying to ship an item home and Molly, the manager, personally tried to help solve it. While it did not work out the way we wanted, Molly went above and beyond to try and help us and we ended up getting to know her a little bit and we felt our needs were listened to and were addressed fully. No lip service here. AND she graciously sat down to have a sip of champagne when she was off the clock. What a pleasure she and her staff are!

Something to be aware of is that although the location is really convenient (easy walking distance to Union Sq) the street does have a lot of homeless people hanging around which can be a little daunting although we had no hassle at all and the hostel is hot on security.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"If you read any of my reviews, I am a hostel regular. This is how I do all of my traveling. I came to SF City Center after my pick from last year was fully booked up and I was apprehensive after reading the reviews about the dodgy location.

It was not as bad as I thought. This is actually one of the better hostels I have had the pleasure of staying at. 

The location of the hostel can be considered spotty, there are a lot of homeless people but as long as your friendly and respectful, they will be very nice towards you. I still would not suggest being out on your own late at night.

The rooms are beyond clean and you get a fresh towel every day. Each room has its own bathroom which if you stay at any hostel one bathroom for four people is HUGE!! The beds can be considered a little too soft (and my sheets kept sliding everywhere).But this is a personal preference. 

The kitchen can get a little too hectic at times to cook a meal. But the area has a few great little hidden gem restaurants. Breakfast is simple, but you get the option to pay 1.00 and you can have four fresh eggs cooked for you or four pancakes. 

There is an onsite bar at night which gives you an affordable option to relax, get a drink and enjoy the company of your fellow hostelers.

Most of the staff is amazing and they really want to do what it takes to help you make the most out of your trip. A few of the staff seems super shy though which can make some think they dont care. 

The big key to enjoying things here, embrace the area; be aware of your surroundings and you will enjoy it. 

I will be back, it was a perfect place to rest my head marathon week.",7/1/2015,4,Solo
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"We arrived at the hostel after dark and on first sight it seemed like we had made a huge mistake picking this hostel. The street which the hostel is located on is intimidating due to the number of homeless people who walk up and down the street. However, once inside the hostel our opinions were completely changed. The staff were very friendly and helped with all our queries no matter what time we asked. They provided a map, marked locations and points of interest along with travel advice on how to get to these locations. Everything was made very easy for us. The room itself was basic, you get what you pay for. Although it doesn't have a tv, the room was always clean with daily bed changing. The toilet was small but is private and contains a shower and sink. Breakfast was free but you could pay $1 for 4 pancakes or 4 eggs which are made fresh in front of you and taste great. If you are looking for a place to rest your head while you take in the sights of San Francisco then I would definitely recommend this hostel. My only tip would be to not walk around this area at night.",7/1/2015,4,Couple
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"You might regret when you walk down the street where the hostel is located, but don’t worry. The hostel is a good one. Clean, simple rooms and nice public areas on two floors. They have a bar with reasonable prices and happy hours, the same place where they serve breakfast. It might be crowded during morning hours, but you can find a place to eat your breakfast somewhere around in the lobby or on the first floor. They have refrigerators for your food and plenty of space to cook it. For breakfast, they serve tea, coffee, juice, bagels, jam, some fruits and porridge. 

The wifi is good both in the lobby and in the room. 

The service at the front desk is good, but it might be a little bit slow when there are many people checking in at the same time. 

Location is good, there are some good restaurants not too far from the hostel. I find this a reasonable place to stay if you want to save some money, stay central in a clean SF hostel.",6/1/2015,4,Friends

The hostel has a good friendly atmosphere. You can walk to the Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39 in just over 20mins or there is a bus stop not far from the hostel.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I stayed 3 days 7/10-7/13/15. This was my first hostel stay in my home state. My friend and I found this place to have a great laid back, ecclectic vibe. The location is a little rough, but it's not so bad that you will run for the hills. It is not far from Civic Center Bart and it's close to the buslines, a plus if you buy the clipper card like we did. The staff was welcoming and helped us to navigate the city in a safe manner (listen to their advice and mind the map they provide). We had the 4 bed dorm with bathroom. As an only child, using our bunk bed was pretty cool but hard on my short legs! It was surprisingly comfortable! The personal light and multiple outlets were lifesavers! We had clean sheets, fresh towels everyday, and the storage provided was a perfect fit for our luggage. The shower was amazing, you can't often say that when it comes to lodging. Our bathroom was clean despite being small. Our only complaint was about our new roommies on the second night of our stay. The last thing you want to experience after a long 12 hour excursion filled day is to be awakened at 2:45 a.m. by new, incoming, inconsiderate roommates. 
We loved the breakfast that was provided every morning and the $1 pancakes and $1 eggs were a nice touch! ( thank you Oscar!!) The kitchen had everything we needed and more. 
I'm sad we were gone all day for each day of our stay because I didn't get to try the on site bar. In all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I know next time I will definitely come back on my next visit.",7/1/2015,4,Friends

Bagels, toast, juice, tea and coffee (real coffe, not American coffee) was included in the price and for only $1 you could get pancakes or eggs. Or both. We're not sure. Anyway, you won't go hungry when you head out into the city! Chinatown is just a few blocks away and pier 33 from where the Alcatraz cruise leaves takes about a little less than an hour to walk to. 

The whole place is warm, welcoming and has an awesome style to it. An extra bonus for the events and tips they had for the city. And that they were really proud to have the colors of PRIDE the week before the parade!

Additionally the bar at the ground level of the hostel is a great place to relax and meet great people and the breakfast was awesome! They even have great wifi! The staff did let us know that there was a not so desirable area of the city near the hostel, but let us know about the safe areas.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I just write to warn everyone about this hl. Please for your own sake keep looking. In my own experience:
Terrifying area: There are plenty of yonkees and homeless in the area. We were so afraid we got a taxi to get back at night after a visit to Alcatraz. Taxi driver told us to thank god for not getting robbed when we walked from metro station.
Room lacked of everything: Not a single appliance... nor even a tv. The mattress was tiny for 2 people and was really unconfortable. It was impossible to have a relaxing shower as the water was either boiling or cold. The bed sheets were not cleaned properly and the experience was gross.
The breakfast included in the price lacked of everything you may expect. Cups and spoons have to cleaned after usage... so imagine the level of cleanliness around... pretty bad.
So, as a conclussion, we are happy we survived the experience and left the area harmless. Definitely not the place to take your wife in your honeymoon as I did. San Francisco is a wonderful city:do not let this hostel to spoil your experience.",4/1/2015,1,Couple

Everything is austere as in most Youth Hostels but the staff makes an effort beyond, in cleaningness, atmosphere, service, even brakfast can be a little more filling. I had a look at the dorms and they seem quite nice, I would definetly come back here when in town. It does seem located in the middle of a pretty wasted area hosting many shelters for homeless people wich means you meet up an improvised camping every corner when you go outside. But hey, its San FCo, that´s the mood and they are not going to bite you, the most, they will shout senseless things or ask for chain. I liked the location because we were at walking distance of most places I wanted to see (The Mission, Castro, Market St, parks) and to easy transportation.

We stayed in a private room on the sixth floor with our own ensuite and as seems to be the case with private rooms at hostels there was no TV. Which was ok by us.

I didn't feel safe coming back after dark and was told upon arrival that we shouldn't enter the area spanning 2-3 blocks behind the hostel. I spoke with a few of the people on the streets and mostly they were all very nice but there are some nasty people, also this area STINKS I cannot emphasise that enough.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I have stayed here twice, once with my wife and young son and once solo. Both times have been an exceptional stay. Much like many HI's this one is family friendly. In fact, we had parcels sent here before we arrived and they stored them for us. The parcel was our 'travel crib' which we purchased online!!

This HI had many different city events which gave something for my wife and son to do while I was attending a conference. They also provide great breakfasts (for cheap) as well as some home cooked supper (also affordable). They also provide some evening movies.

Unfortunately, the local area is a bit seedy. The tenderloin neighborhood is known for both drugs and prostitution. It also doesnt help that inner city services are offered just a few blocks a way. As a result, you can find yourself walking in some questionable areas. But the homeless are generally harmless and my wife and young son had no problems walking in the neighborhood.

There are a LOT of vietnemese restaurants right down the street.",10/1/2014,4,Family

The location is within walking distance to several public transportation points. The one concern that may bother some is that this hotel is on the border of a district that is associated with drug use and schizophrenics. This isn't just my opinion, but was pointed out to me by hotel staff. It doesn't bother me personally, and I walked through these areas several times to get to public transport, but it isn't the best surrounding area day or night.

The staff is very very friendly and helpful (seriously, they're awesome!) and the environment encourages contact between guests, with movies and other attractions. There are no TVs in the rooms, for example. So people can focus on knowing each other. The breakfast is quite decent. Excellent cost/benefit.

Problems: there's a lot of homeless people in the area. They are not violent nor dangerous. But it is quite common to see them asking guests for a change/some coins. And the smell on some streets is not the most pleasant. You need to walk a few blocks more to divert some of the most problematic streets. Still, the hostel is excellent.

In the morning, they have a great free breakfast and for only one dollar plus, you can ask for pancakes or scrambled eggs. It's delicious! Also, they offer 24 hours coffee and tea. At nights they have a bar working inside the hostel. So, you can drink some beers and have fun with your partner, friends or with another guests. 

The location of the hostel is very convenient to go to everywhere, but the surrounding area is full of homeless people. Because of that, it has a bad and smelly environment on the sidewalk in this area. It was not a big problem for us, but sometimes it's a little inconvenient.

Breakfast is a bit of an elbow sharpening experience, but pretty good quality considering.

Unfortunately, My bed had bed bugs which ruined the experience for me. The first night I squished a tiny bug on the mattress which left a small blood splat. As I did not have my glasses on I could not identify the bug. I reported it to the front desk in the morning. The girl at the desk said she would make a report to maintenance and suggested that it might be a tick. Hoping she was right and not seeing anything else during the day, I went to bed the second night only to wake up at one in the morning with a bed bug by my head. I was able to catch this one, identify it, and bring it to the front desk. The guy at the desk said he had never seen a bed bug, so could not identify it but was able to switch my room. I did not find any evidence of bed bugs in my second room. 

While the staff was courteous, they were in no way apologetic or helpful and did not seem to have any training as to how to identify bed bugs or respond to the situation which seems odd for the hospitality industry.

The general area also smells like urine..... . Asides from this the hostel is like a little oasis. The front reception area was awesome and rooms were spacious and clean. It got very loud at night though due to some nearby construction work and also addicts yelling in the street at all hours of the night. Staff were ok. We arrived at about 2:35 from a big journey and were told check in was at 3 so to wait. Seriously? can't we check in 25 mins early? We came back at 3 to a tonne of people in reception who had obviously been told the same thing. Finally at 3:10 we are able to check in after watching 4 idol staff members wandering around reception.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"First of all I am not a big complainer. I have stayed in many a hostel and know both how good and bad the experinece can be. I have delt with many crumby waiters, desk clerks and employees but this manager really struck a cord with me and I really wanted to share my experinece in case it can make a difference for guests who stay here in the future. Or choose not to because of this review. 

Second of all I have to disclose I did not stay overnight in this hostel. I was visiting with friends who checked in as they were spending the night here after a birthday party. I was denyed entry to accompany them to their room, which is not disclosed in the booking information and should be updated. But fair enough, if you want to be strict to protect the guests. Many hostels in my travels allow guests up until a certain hour in the evening and if you check in at the desk with the guest. Perhaps this would be a good suggestion for an update on your rules. But please explain to your manager he does not need to be rude about it.

While waiting for our friend to get ready in the room, as we could not accompany her, we went to sit in the hostel bar and have a drink. The manager of the hostel walks into the hostel bar and sees the two of us and a paying hostel guest (one of our friends) sitting at the bar and says nothing but instantly walks out. A few minutes later, after having a drink and talking amongst ourselves and the bar tender, the manager sends a worker in to ask us if we are guests in the hostel and that we would need to leave if we were not. I found this very bizarre. Even after a rude encounter with the manager (chalk it upto maybe he's having a bad day) we decided to go into the bar and spend our money in this establishment. While not bothering anyone and minding our own buisness as paying customers we are asked to leave? Something is off with this buisness model. It was actually a bit like being harassed.

I was rather insulted to say the least. I told the worker sent forward to deliver this message that I am very sorry the manager has made you the messanger and did not deal with this issue he has with me himself. But I have been to many hostels in many places around the world and I am rather insulted. It is not posted that people who are not staying in the hostel cannot enter the bar or the property. And basically what you are asking is that I go outside and wait on the street for my friend while I am doing nothing wrong, breaking no rules and spending money here? I also requested that if the manager has a personal problem with me he can please come forward and discuss it with me rather than sending a hostel worker. It was really disapointing to say the least. So after my poor treatment there my advice to groups of travelers or 2 or more check out hotel rates around SF and see if you can get anything better for the same price or avoid this hostel and spend your money at one that is managed by a nicer manager or at least until he has had an attitude adjustment.",7/1/2014,1,Friends

The kitchen was the largest out of all of the hostels we have stayed in and there's was plenty of room for everybody. It was great that you could get a breakfast of either pancakes or omelettes for $1

The only downside is that the hostel is not very sociable, there doesn't seem to be very many appealing activities to do
E.g some hostels do pub crawls, trips out etc. Despite that the tea tasting was great and the guy running it was very interesting and knowledgeable.

My top tip for anybody staying in this hostel is to make sure you are prepared to get taxi back to the hostel when you are our for the evening especially if you are a vulnerable person as the mentally ill/ homeless people in the tenderloin area can be quite frightening. However a taxi never cost us more than $6 so that was good.

We were split between the 2nd and 3rd floors. The rooms were nice. There is limited space for eating and meeting for a group our size. We usually met in the mezzanine and others didn't seem to mind that we pretty much took up one entire half and sometimes had to spread to the other half as well. We were usually up and out by 8:00 AM and didn't return until 7:00-8:00 PM. The bagels and toast were nice in the morning before leaving. We took advantage of egg/pancake breakfast for $1 each one morning when we slept in a bit and it was well worth it. It was very good! If you need a place to eat for your large group, Tommy's Joynt is within walking distance of the hostel and was GREAT! The people there were so accommodating and the food was really good. Nice space upstairs for a group to sit together. For a place for a large group to stay at a reasonable price in San Francisco, this place worked well for us.",6/1/2014,4,Business
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"This was our first stay in a hostel, and what an excellent experience we had.

Firstly the staff there are great, really helpful to the point of even managing to get our recently purchased computer to work when our Tablet had broken on our first night of our stay.

The breakfast that was included in the cost consisted of a choice of bagels, cream cheese, porridge, tea and coffee or you could pay $2 for eggs or pancakes. The communal kitchen was always clean and tidy and had more than adequate equipment and storage facilities for you to self cater which we did on a couple of evenings. 

At the time we stayed they had movie nights which included complimentary popcorn which was a nice touch. The bar is open in the evenings with a Happy Hour which has a great ambience and great to fellow travellers.

Our room which was a double ensuite was on the second floor, it was serviced every day with new towels if we had requested them. 

The location is a little scary at first as there are alot of homeless in the area however no one approached or hassled us. I would suggest getting a taxi if you were going into the town centre in the evening though, we only walked a few streets in the dark. 

There is a lovely deli and winebar nearby, and the walk to Union Square took around 20 mins. 

We used the local transport which was easy for getting around.

We would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone.",4/1/2014,5,Couple

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I booked a deluxe double room with a private bathroom, to myself, as a cheaper alternative to staying in a hotel. The room was excellent - just like a hotel, if not better! It was very clean and comfortable, and nicely decorated. The communal areas had good facilities, were fun, generally good atmosphere. The staff were extremely helpful, I loved all their recommendations, and their advice was spot on. Thanks guys! I was only there for a limited time, but there seemed to be lots going on in the hostel and lots of fun activities on offer. As a solo female traveller, I found the area a little 'iffy'. When you arrive the staff mark on a map the area around the hostel you should avoid walking through, which is helpful of them, but is unnerving. And I can believe it, because there was a fair bit of yelling going on outside, at all hours, and some unsavoury characters lurking along the street. I live in a city centre myself, so I am confident enough to handle this kind of thing, and nothing bad happened to me at all. Plus the desk is manned 24 hours, so once you're inside the hostel it feels safe. I'd probably stay here again. But if you're more nervous / cautious, then maybe this won't be ideal for you. The other San Francisco Hostelling International hostel (Downtown) is nearby, but in a safer, nicer area, and more conveniently located for the city's attractions etc.",6/1/2014,4,Solo

- The neighbourhood is bad (wouldn't like to be there alone at night time). badly situated on Ellis street, only leave and enter the area via Larkins street!
- felt safe because you have to show your ""hostel pass"" on _each_ entry. (Did I say the neighborhood is bad?)
- Room: ok, but had not enough stowage (especially when you stay there more than one night). 
- Bathroom was partly clean & very small. I think no one ever cleaned the sink drain. water pressure bad. water temperature unsteady (cold to hot in a sec)

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"I recently stayed here with a friend because it was the most affordable way we could stay near union square in SF. This place is nothing special, but there are friendly staff and sufficient accommodations. The only complaints I have are that there were no outlets in the bathroom so we had to blow dry our hair in the mezzanine which was kind of awkward. But for about $30/night it was worth the inconvenience. Be advised that Ellis street is a bit shady, but if you walk up a street and then go towards union square the walk will be much more pleasant. Ellis street is littered with homeless people, so if you are uncomfortable with that I would suggest you stay elsewhere. I would stay here again though, just because it made visiting SF affordable and did offer all of the necessities (shower, bed, bagels + coffee for breakfast).",5/1/2014,3,Friends
San Francisco City Center Hostel,,The hostel is nice. The people who work there is awesome. Very helpful and helpful. The only problem with this hostel is the location. Even if I didn't have any episode of violence there is a very unsafe neighborhood. During the night if you don't have car you have to make a lot of extra block to avoid drugs dealers.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"We were well informed about the location, that being said, it is pretty dodgy if you find yourself walking down the wrong street. We always aimed to be back before dark or got a taxi. The room was lovely, having an ensuit was a bonus. We were right under the stairs though which was a little noisy. Also, people yelling in the hall way at 2am every night. Staff were ok. Breakfast was good but some fruit or yogurt would have been nice as after bagels for four mornings in a row started to feel unhealthy. Apart from the dodgyness of the location, the location was good walking distance to places to eat or the bus stop. I do think for where it is, it's a little expensive.

San Francisco City Center Hostel,,"And I have no problem with the ghetto, in fact, it's really quite an interesting, eclectic area that seats the San Francisco City Center Hostel. We were only here for about 12 hours, but in that time we saw plenty to keep us talking. 

Check in was slow. The room, a 6 x bed dorm was fine, spacious, with private bathroom and views out onto the street. The in-house bar is cool, but was a little disappointed we couldn't bring outside guests in to have a drink, as we were meeting friends in the area and would've been nice to have some chilled out beers at the hostel first, although on the other hand, I do understand why they do this and security is very good.

There are some cool dive bars a short stroll away and I think given more time, it would've been a good area to explore. Some may not feel particularly safe here, as it doesn't lend itself as the friendliest neighbourhood in town.

However I didn't feel very safe, outside there were lots of homeless people especially at night. Would recommend going in groups if going on nights out. Also the reception door takes a while to close. Also the shuttle ride to the airport was the worst ride ever. The driver had a random person in the car who clearly wasn't going to the airport.

Orange Village Hostel,,"I guess you get your money’s worth. Still, it’s not THAT cheap. The location is perfect: walking distance to stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, etc. And you can get pretty much everywhere by Lyft / Uber with 8-18 USD. When I went, the lobby was under renovations. But the rooms and the hostel in general is old. Clean and with the essentials, but it does feel like an old European apartment building. The bunker beds are very low (especially if you’re on the lower bed, the bed above is VERY low). The bathroom is VERY small (I got a room with 4 beds and a private bathroom). It was clean but I couldn’t literally reach my feet. The shower is TOO small. The staff is nice enough but there isn’t a lot of engagement with the guests, trying to make people getting to know other guests like in some hostels. It does have a kitchen and a living / TV room which I used once (there’s free breakfast: toast, bananas, coffee and that’s it). Which is nice, considering it’s a hostel. 

I would recommend it if you want to save some bucks or traveling on a budget and if you want to meet people / are open to having people in your room. It can always be a super nice experience (I’ve met cool people) or a bad and uncomfortable one too.",8/1/2018,3,Solo

No soaps in all the WC neither the public ones.
Breakfast is very poor: bread, cornflakes , nutella and peanut butter.
I noticed that there was no coffee anymore, i asked the worker there if i can have coffee, she said "" i don't care"".

The hostel is also near the Tenderloin district which is not the best areas of San Fran. The hostel is outdated and could certainly do with refurbishment .

On a positive note, breakfast was simple but fun with a waffle maker and bananas nutella etc. There was building work when we were there which made it a very undesirable building indeed (cannot be helped but maybe could have been mentioned before we came)

I think that for the price this is very overpriced for what is a very basic hostel, in a rough area (didn't bother us too much but it is in the Tenderloin) and they clearly did not clean a lot.

Room was small but clean. There was a microwave and fridge which was useful. The berth room was a good size and the shower worked well.

The common areas really smelt of strong air freshener which was overpowering. 

The shared kitchen was good - modern with good cooking facilities. It also had a good breakfast from 7am. Waffles, toast, cereals, fruits tea and coffee. The waffles and Nutella were very popular! 

The location is great and the biggest draw card for us. Close to Union Square, trams, BART, shops restaurants and bars. As this is downtown, there are sly a lot of homeless people and beggars.

Orange Village Hostel,,"After reading that San Francisco being the most expensive city in the US, alarm bells started to ring that it may be hard to find accomodation on a budget.
What the Orange Village Hostel provided myself and my friend was a twin room with 2 single beds and an en-suite bathroom, granted the room was small but that didn't bother us because we didn't intend to stay in the room that much apart from when we were sleeping.
Within the room there were hangers to hang clothes along with a set of drawers, a TV, fan, microwave and also a half height fridge. There was a dedicated access point in our room for wireless, not sure if this was the case for all rooms but it was for us.
We were on the 5th floor looking on to O'Farrell St, a bit noisy with the window open and if you had the window closed then you definately required use of the fan.
We paif £100 a night and that included breakfast, which was ideal because it was cereal, fruit, yoghurts, tea and coffee, toast and other breads along with the choice of a waffle maker that you could use if you felt confident enough.
There was a fridge that you could label and store refrigerated foods, all the other mod cons that a normal kitchen would have.
The breakfast set you up for the day and it wasn't another expense to shell out for when you are out exploring.
The hostel is in the Union Square area which is ideal, a 5 minute walk to the Dragon Gate into China Town, a 5 minute walk to California St for the trolley and Powell St BART station that can take you to the Airport and also across to Oakland if you wanted.
If you walk down to Market St and follow it along NE it takes you to the main ferry terminal and a walk along to Pier 33 for the Alcatraz tour and also Pier 39 for the amusements.
AT&T Park is only a 30 min walk down to Market St then down 3rd Street and it's at the bottom, a few not bad bars for pre game drinks.
Great location, loved it, right next door to the Hilton also so not such a bad area.
I've seen previous reviews moaning about the homeless causing bother, this is nonsence, be polite if they ask you for anything, acknowledge them and say no thanks and they won't cause you any bother.
Reception booked us a shared ride van back to the airport that was $15 each, I thought this was ideal.

Love the shelf & night light for each bed. Market next door has a lot & good prices. A lot of places close by. Considered ""Tenderloin"" but close to Hilton & felt safe. 2nd flour can be a little loud from street noise & 7th is super quiet but can get hot, so bring earplugs & a fan!

Orange Village Hostel,,"I was staying in a 4 bed girls dorm. The room wasn't huge but had enough room in it for everything. We had a private bathroom which again wasn't massive but it was fine. We had another bathroom outside the room as well so if someone was in ours we didn't have to wait which was nice. I definitely felt safe in my room. They had massive lockers which was a plus! 

The whole hostel has a really relaxed vibe and I genuinely had a nice time staying there. There was a shop next door so I could grab beers/snacks and they have a kitchen were you can cook food. Breakfast was great and there is toasters and you can make waffles. I ate so much every morning! There was a woman complaining in the reception about how she left disappointed by the hotel but I'm not sure what she was expecting. You get a lot for how little it costs to stay here. 

The area it is in might be a bit rough but just be sensible and you will be fine.",9/1/2016,4,Solo
Orange Village Hostel,,"I stayed here for 3 nights. It's very clean, the kitchen/breakfast area is well stocked (toaster, blender, fridge) and has a lot of food (fruit, bread, cereal and milk). The hostel itself is right in the middle of downtown San Francisco about two blocks from Union Square and the BART station. It's EXTREMELY affordable and I had no problems. Just for general information there's a liquor/convenience store literally right next to it. I enjoyed my stay. I stayed in a four person dorm room (two bunk beds, bathroom, and lockers for your stuff). Bed was comfortable and each bed had a lamp so you could have light at night.",11/1/2016,4,Business

The TV didn't seem to work but there was a microwave and a fridge in the room. You can borrow a hair dryer at the front desk. The kitchen space is not very big so it can be a little crowded during breakfast but that's not really a problem. The breakfast was nice: milk, juice, toast, waffle, bananas, yogurt, cereal...etc.
Overall very good for the price in downtown San Francisco.",12/1/2016,4,Business
Orange Village Hostel,,"Twin private room ensuite was super comfortable and clean, microwave, mini fan and fridge very useful. I had a great sleep during the 3 nights I stayed. The maintenance people were very kind and helpful, not the same as the people in reception. Perfect location to take the metro and even you have touristic places walking distance, the liquor store downstairs outside the hostel was perfection, lots of bars and rests around, highly recommended.
The staff in reception were very rude, probably not all of them but this guy during night shift was very rude with me and my friend when we asked him something, but hey we had a great time there.",5/1/2016,4,Friends
Orange Village Hostel,,"Overall a decent value. The room was larger than expected with decent mattresses. Be careful with the furniture since it's similar to IKEA quality. The private bath shower had mold on the ceiling and it's the size of a stall but served its purpose. The cleaning personnel missed an open bar of soap clinging to the shower walls and there aren't any ledges to place your shower stuff. There are no wash cloths, only large hand towels. My one and only gripe would be the loud street noise even with all the windows closed. It would also be awesome if a ceiling fan or stand fan was available so you could leave the window closed. There are a lot of homeless around the area but no one seemed to bother anyone besides the occasional panhandling. Even though there is a sign posted outside of the hostel door that says ""No smoking within 25 feet"" people are still smoking and the rule was not enforced. We even noticed hotel staff smoking at the front door.",10/1/2016,3,Couple

Orange Village Hostel,,"It's been 10yrs since I stayed in a hostel when travelling. It was required in San Fran as I was solo and it's so expensive. Was in a four bed dorm which had a little sink, small lockers for all and a small nook on one side of the room for one person to spread out in and enough space above the two bunks for another two people to spread out their stuff a bit more. I was there for 4 nights and had a few roomies. All were respectful and considerate. I thought I would be first in bed most nights as I was solo and not wanting to do much at night after big days, seemed my roomies were the same. Every time I used the shower (separate room with toilet) it was clean, dry and empty. The water was only luke warm but I didn't mind. I didn't have breakfast, looked a bit basic and couldn't be bothered jostling around real backpackers who needed a free meal more than me. Great cafe around the corner which is smaller and narrow and always has a line but moves quickly. Amazing breakfast and reasonable price. Beds were a bit hard but I didn't mind. Got two pillows. Great handy location. Tours picked up from the Hilton next door.",9/1/2016,4,Solo
Orange Village Hostel,,"When we booked the room at the Orange Village Hostel it seemed to be the cheapest option available (we booked 5 months in advance, we had planned a 15 days trip on the road) and we nearly paid 500£ for a room with two beds for 3 nights. We thought it was going to be a cozy, friendly place as suggested by the nice pictures. Well not really. The staff was ok, the position is pretty central but the place itself is absolutely not worth the money. I am really not one to care that much where I spend the night and I've slept in all sorts of motels during my trip but for THAT MUCH money it was absolute robbery. The building is old, our room - although clean enough - was rough and not cosy at all. The breakfast offering was a very basic continental (no croissant, some pretty stale toast and bagel and the orange juice tasted like a cheap energy drink). As a joke we googled hotels in San Francisco and were able to find some hotels with last minute deals around the area for half the price. It was the beginning of our much awaited holiday and we didn't want to spoil it with complaints but we still feel like we were robbed of 500£ . Not a place I would recommend to anyone unless the prices get more competitive",8/1/2016,2,Friends

Orange Village Hostel,,"Before coming to Orange Village, I read the reviews about the area and was a bit nervous. However, I had absolutely no troubles whilst staying here. There are a few homeless people, but they are absolutely harmless and merely asking for money. I felt completely safe here, even at night times! Just need to have your wits about you, and be careful on the streets a few over.

The hostel itself was fine - a nice place to base yourself. We had a double ensuite room, which I'd highly recommend. The street was noisy, so bring some earplugs, but didn't bother us too much.

Breakfast was nice, lots of carbs, but good to fuel you for the day. Try get there a bit earlier to beat the rush. 

Overall, had a lovely time here! Staff were nice, rooms were comfortable and the area was so perfect - close to everything and public transport down to Fishermans Wharf.",8/1/2016,4,Couple

I especially like the female ensuite dorms, Safe, and some of the most respectful hostell goers I have encountered here in the US.

Down side , as are a lot of places San Fran it is surrounded by homeless.

Good part is that you have to be buzzed in to enter. Extra security!

Over all, if you are a traveler on a budget ( and most of us are in San Fran) this is a cool enclave of travlers and comforatable space for a low price.",8/1/2016,4,Solo
Orange Village Hostel,,"I stayed at this hostel for several nights which is located close to union square which is a centrally located area to stay in san fran.

I stayed in a 4 bed dorm (bunks) and as its a hostel it was all fairly basic. There were lockers to store some of your valuables. They provide sheets and a towel. The only issues with the room are that the bed is not overly comfortable and the bunks make alot of noise whenever someone moves. 

There is alot of homeless in the area and whilst loud they didnt bother me. Night can be a bit noisy with sirens and also some of the homeless people outside. Bring earplugs. Travel wise i either walked or used uber everywhere. They have a limited subway system that is of use to tourists.

The hostel provides a basic breakfast of cereals, breads, bananas, yoghurt and a waffle maker which was good. There is kitchen facilities to make your own meals and a lounge area with tv.

Accomodation is expensive in san fran and this hostel was more costly than most hostels i have stayed at. For my stay the hostel served it purpose and i had a relatively comfortable stay but next time would probably go for my own room.

The staff were mostly very pleasant and helpful, one particular lady wasn't.",8/1/2016,4,Solo

I only brought back the bed sheets and Ellis had the audacity and stupidity of raising her voice. She behaved like a psycho cause I didn't have the towels ( i left them in the room). I understand that probably some customers forget to bring back but I did what I was told.

Orange Village Hostel,,"This hostel is best for his location! It is a couple of blocks away from Union Square, which has some lovely shops and restaurants and good transport links to the rest of the city. The Powell St Cable Car goes up and down and goes straight to Fishermans Wharf and it is a good area to get Taxi's and Uber's quickly to travel around the city.
The hostel in itself is clean, tidy and although in some parts not the most modern of hostels I have stayed in I did enjoy my stay. The lift is a bit frightening when you first get in it but was safe and we never had any problems with it.
Front office staff were helpful and gave us discount vouchers to use for bike rental which meant we got them for $18 instead of $32 as we booked them through the hostel.
Breakfast options were good, offering toast, bagels, waffles and cereals. The breakfast is served between 7am - 10am so you need to get up in good time to get down there, but the kitchen area is nice and modern and was never too busy when I went down to get breakfast. 
We opted for a private room as there wasn't much difference in the price and were pleased with what we got. The room had two single beds and a fridge, microwave, sink and chest of drawers with a wardrobe. There was lots of room to put all of our clothes in and the room felt safe and secure. 
Overall I would recommend staying at this hostel, although some parts are not as modern as other hotels I have stayed in the US they are clearly making an effort to upgrade areas of the hostel like the kitchen and living/communal areas.

We stayed on the side facing O'Farrell St, and it was quite noisy with sirens often blaring down the street. I also recommend bringing ear plugs.

Other then the noise and the towels, the staff were really nice and helpful and were more then happy to switch your change over for the washing machines. The common room was really nice and a great place to come down and watch TV and socialise. Wifi was free and pretty fast.",12/1/2015,4,Friends

They have really good activities, pizza nights and nightclub nights out and stuff. The breakfast was actually pretty good, too. We stayed in a double room with a shared bathroom, and that was reasonably clean. All throughout the night we could hear this family with a child and a dog and a really loud tv (must have been a residential apartment nearby) and that really interrupted our sleep, but really we didn't spend much time in the room apart from sleeping.

Pros

-Breakfast is awesome (toast, waffles, bananas,jam, peanut butter, nutela, 3 types cereal. Tea and coffee.
-Kitchen is very busy in morning but quiet at night for cooking dinners. 
-plenty of bathrooms and showers, all clean with good temperature and pressure. 
-WiFi worked in room, not the best but enough to get by.
-Staff were very friendly and helpful.
-good security, 24hour reception and doors that lock.
-private double was more like a hotel. Good storage, TV, fridge, comfy bed.
-Safe part of town, next to Hilton. Lots of homeless people around but that's the case everywhere in San Fran.

Cons

-price, all hostels in US are so expensive though compared to even Australia and New Zealand. 

Useful Info

-less than 10minute walk to big cheap supermarket (Trader Joes). 
-5 minute walk to F tram line that takes you to Fishmans Wharf for Alcatraz, pier 49 and farmers market. Only 2.25 but you need exact money.
-15min walk to Chinatown
-5min walk to subway line where you can get to Baseball stadium.
-5min walk to historic tram turning station.
-5min walk to huge shopping centre and cinema. 
-ask to hire bikes at reception for Golden Gate Bridge. You get a decent discount. Good company. Good bikes.
-if arriving by greyhound or megabus you can walk it in 30mins. We did it but don't do it at night. You have to walk through two of the worst streets in that area of San Fran.

Orange Village Hostel,,"I came to San Fran for business and needed somewhere cheap but central to stay. I found this online and the reviews weren't as bad as for everywhere else so I booked. What I can say is that 'it does what it says on the tin...and the staff do more.'

Room - I stayed in a private room that had an ensuite toilet and shower, there was also a microwave, fridge and TV. The fridge smelled a bit funny so I didn't use it but everything else was fine. The sheets and towels were clean, the pillows were super comfy and the bed gave a comfortable nights sleep. The TV channels were good, the shower was hot with good pressure and the microwave worked. The free wifi also worked perfectly in my room! The only bad thing was that the room overlooked the street so it was very noisy! I felt like my bed was actually on the street - not good when you need undisturbed sleep. Perhaps ask for somewhere near the back? The radiator in my room also made the most awful noise. Apparently it is powered by steam and this is what caused the disruption but once the heating was on the noise was constant - like a whirring noise and clicking sounds. Again, awful when trying to sleep. I tried turning the heater on to see if that released some pressure but this made the noise a million times worse!

Hostel - I used the kitchen 2 out of 4 mornings at breakfast but it was extremely busy and filled with people who looked a bit like they needed a wash (no shock there). There was everything you needed though - toast, waffles, cereal, tea, coffee, nutella, jam, butter... I am gluten-free so none of this was any good for me but if you pop down the road to the Westfield centre you can buy some gluten-free bread in the supermarket downstairs. I did this and then used the butter/tea provided. That was fine. There is also a lounge area to eat in front of the TV, which was nice. There are also laundry facilities, I didn't use them but they looked OK. Although my room smelled fine the rest of the hostel had a bit of a funny smell to it and seemed quite run down - this didn't bother me too much as my room was perfect for what I paid! The place is very secure which is reassuring, they lock the doors and you have to have a key to be allowed in. Excellent!

Location - this is a central place, which means there are a lot of crazy homeless people around so just be on guard. But it was good because a lot of attractions are within walking distance (I walked everyday), there are places to eat and drink nearby and transport to attractions further afield. Of course, this comes at the cost of it being noisy at night.

Staff - I cannot fault the staff, they were excellent! Each staff member was very friendly, very chatty, very helpful and extremely accommodating. I asked for a full length mirror as I'd need one to make sure I looked OK for work - I got one. I thought the TV wasn't working - they sent someone up immediately. I needed something printed - they did it (at a small cost). I was worried about safety - they reassured me. A loved one sent a message for me via email - they printed it and stuck it to my door as a surprise. I wanted to pay before I arrived - they sorted it. I had some questions before I arrived - they answered them all very quickly. One staff member even offered that I could practice my presentation to them. Honestly, they were excellent and I cannot praise them enough.

Overall, this is a cheap place but it is as luxurious as you will get for the money. If you want the Hilton - it is next door! The main thing is that the room was clean and everything was secure. The only big problem for me was the noise, but that isn't something they can really control - get a room at the back!",3/1/2015,3,Business
Orange Village Hostel,,Host is conveniently located near the downtown. Unfortunately it is located in the bad part of the 'Tenderloin.' Be prepared for people defecating outside the hostel door.

Used the luggage room before and after my reservation. Felt my bags were safe as they use a ticket system and staff accompanied me to locked area.

No lounge to sit down and relax or write postcards though, and the kitchen is so small that not even 15 people could eat breakfast at the same time.

Orange Village Hostel,,"It is a cozy place with all basic utilities and no frills: just perfect for the budget traveller. I encountered mostly students here but it wasn't particularly noisy and in fact a rather pleasant stay. The rooms are somewhat small but clean and decently furnished. It was also a bonus to have a bath and toilet attached. The common areas and facilities including the kitchen, laundry, and lounge are simple and well maintained, and the option of a basic breakfast included in the rent was quite useful. The staff are friendly and helpful, and I didn't really have any concerns for safety, though it's best to stay away from wandering into the nearby Tenderloin area especially post-evening.
The biggest attraction of staying in this place is its awesome location. Just a short walk away from the Union Square and Market Street, there is a huge variety of options in transportation, food, and shopping all around. Also, it is amazingly well connected to a variety of tourist destinations in the vicinity and even in other parts of the city.

Orange Village Hostel,,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my brother in July 2014. The hostel has good wifi throughout. The breakfast is minimal and the breakfast room is very cramped. The social areas in the hostel are horrible and are not inducive to a social atmosphere - which the hostel lacks horribly. The rooms were okay but weren't that clean (e.g. cockroaches in the bathroom) and suffered from a lack of light - making it a fairly unpleasant place to stay. Location was great but there is a serious homeless issue in the area so make sure you have your wits about you. We also saw loads of homeless people go up to the 6th floor throughout our stay which was peculiar, though we never found out why.... Suffice to stay, there is no reason to give this hostel a second chance, the experience was deeply unpleasant overall.",7/1/2014,1,Friends

Orange Village Hostel,,"The best part about this hostel is the location. It's close to Union Square and to every kind of public transportation. If you walk the wrong way, you do get into an area that's a bit sketchier, so be aware of your surroundings.

We rented a private room with private bath. The room was small, but it was clean and had everything we wanted. There is free wifi, but it doesn't always work well. The building itself is quite old. The kitchen was too small for the number of people staying at the hostel that weekend (it had only 3 tables), but breakfast was free. In general, the staff was helpfull but the first person we talked to could barely understand us and wasn't able to help.

This hostel is a good inexpensive option if you want a great location and aren't looking for much more from your accomodation.",7/1/2014,3,Couple

Orange Village Hostel,,"Location was SUPERB. We could walk over to the Powell tram stop where you could see the tram turn around and there is lots of shopping and a below-ground visitor centre nearby. It took like 10 minutes for us to walk over. Room was clean but sparse - two single beds, a small writing table and a chair, and a TV hanging over a chest of drawers. Bathroom, including the shower area, was tiny and there were not many spots where you could hang or place your toiletries and clothes - you have to hang your stuff right next to the toilet bowl. But I was still quite happy with Orange Village cos of the fabulous location. The kitchen has a lot of cutlery and breakfast was a simple daily offering of cereal, waffles and hot coffee, but you can check out BK near the Powell tram stop. The laundromart is on the same floor as the kitchen so we popped in our dirty clothes and went to have breakfast. Kitchen is small so there aren't many seats. There is a small lounge on the same floor which I did not check out. You have to sign for the use of hairdryers. There were I think 3 PCs in the lobby. I felt safe as you need to buzz a staff member to let you in. They also offer special airport limo rates, I cannot remember which limo service provider, but the rates are good. There have been comments about the noise but I did not have trouble falling asleep, even though my room was really very near the lift.",10/1/2013,3,Family
Orange Village Hostel,,"This Hostel is located a few streets away from the BART and MUNI station. For the price I paid, I believe that it is fair to give this place 5 stars. The rooms had hardwood floors, power outlets and the shower had running hot water. BRING EARPLUGS! This hostel is located in the busiest and loudest areas of the city. One night, I woke up around 3AM to the sound of taxi drivers getting into a fight, and fist fight. The second night there was a bad accident that woke everyone (Without earplugs) up. 

The elevators are old school but I loved it. Breakfast was great, I loved their waffles. Overall everything was clean and best of all i did NOT experience a foul odor smell. Wifi was fast at all times.",5/1/2014,5,Solo

Orange Village Hostel,,"The reception is a busy vibrant hub, with nice helpful female staff, armed with heaps of information on what activities to do on your journey in the city.
We chose a twin room at the front of the building that included a bathroom. The room was adequate with a flat screen tv, microwave, fridge, desk, drawers and clothes hanging area. The room was clean except for the harden vomit on the wall at head level that I had to remove before settling in for our four night stay. 
Our first night was sleepless due to the noisy fire engines, loud street drunks and internal noises however the second night we had naturally adjusted and slept without interruption. 
We had come from 4 star hotels before heading to San Fran and had looked long and hard for a good deal there to no avail. After experiencing this city we were delighted not to have paid ridiculously for the overpriced hotels there. I would suggest only the easy going and low maintenance people of this world book into this hostel so they can fully enjoy its spirit. Don’t book because it’s cheap and then complain like crazy.....you have been warned!!!",9/1/2013,3,Friends
Orange Village Hostel,,I found the Orange Village hostel to be good value for the price you pay. The location is great as you are close to Union Square and all the touristy stuff but you are also close to the good non-touristy areas like the Mission district and Castro. I have read some people say its a bad area because its right near the tenderloin which is where the homeless people are centered and its scary. Yes it is right near the tenderloin but we spent 5 nights walking through this area at all times of night and never had one remotely scary experience. Most of the time you walk through this area and none of the homeless even seem to notice you so please don't be worried about this. We stayed in a private room and it was basic but had all that you need and was clean. The staff were very friendly and helped us out on several occasions. The bed was pretty old and worn but you expect that in a hostel. Breakfast is the standard hostel breakfast and they have a good laundry that is not expensive. Would definitely recommend staying at this hostel.,9/1/2013,4,Couple
Orange Village Hostel,,"I'll start with the pros. This hostel is clean; our room and bathroom didn't feel dirty. They had wifi and plenty of outlets in the room. It was cheap.

Now for the cons. The main con for this hostel is the location. We were warned by a local to stay away from a certain area of the city because it has become overrun with homeless men. Little did we know the hostel was on that street. We arrived after dark and had to park two blocks away, which would have been fine in another area of the city. So there we were, two girls carrying our bags through crowds of drunk homeless men down dark streets in a strange city. I have stayed in hostels in Europe and never felt unsafe, but this was the most unsettling travel experience I have ever had. The room was also noisy- I could hear people fighting and garbage trucks on the street all hours of the night. 

If it was in a different location, it would be an okay place to stay",10/1/2013,1,Friends
Orange Village Hostel,,"Pros: cheap, good location, rooms passably clean, towel provided, free Internet.
Cons: rude, rude staff. A pain to have to walk past their unsmiling faces at the reception. Beware the unhelpful guy with the greasy brown hair and sour face! Bathrooms small, with slightly frightening textured walls. Lockers in rooms but you bring your own lock. 
Comments: There isn't a big difference between rooms with private and shared bathrooms, so save your money.

Conclusion: did someone say cheap? Those of us who can't afford the neighboring Hilton can't be choosers.",9/1/2013,3,Solo
Orange Village Hostel,,"Great location to be able to walk everywhere. Even though this is at the edge of the Tenderloin, we didn't have any troubles. Despite the odd fellow asking for money or a smoke when I was outside, they were harmless. The staff buzz you in the door so you have a level of safety. I was in a private double room with sink (shared toilet and shower). It was small room but perfectly fine for the two of us. Great storage for clothes and added bonus of a fridge & TV (which we never did get working). I'd read other reviews beforehand about lack of power points and they weren’t joking. They provided a power pack for 3 items, the fridge took up one so we only had two power points for two people and all of our phones, iPads, and cameras. We had an internal facing room and it was dark but also quiet. The communal bathroom was clean. The private rooms don't have lockers. We were a little worried about leaving our items in the room, but we did it anyways and just asked that the room wasn't cleaned. Nothing was stolen even though we took a risk. Friendly staff.",8/1/2013,4,Couple
Orange Village Hostel,,"This is my second visit to Orange Village for the last 3 years.

Convenient spot. The hostel itself is somehow redecorated a bit. It is neat as i remembered. The breakfast is simple as usual. But the waffle mixture is good enough to for me while travelling with a tight budget.

Last time i stayed in a private room and found it very good. However, this time i tried a room with bunk beds. The bed is not good enough, it is not strong will move around if the one above / below is moving. this impacts a lot the sleeping quality.

The bathroom is super tiny.

There is no desk nor any chair for a 4 ppl room. and not enough power for 4 ppl charging their electronics.

Will consider changing another one when visit SF again",7/1/2013,3,Friends
Orange Village Hostel,,"Had I not spent the night at USA Hostels around the corner the previous night, this place would probably receive a higher rating. I stayed in a private en-suite with a queen sized bed. Just like any other hostel, toilets and showers are shared. they do offer shuttle service to SFO but I did not use it. major selling point is that its walking distance to everything around Union Square and good access to BART and Cable Cars.",7/1/2013,3,Solo
Orange Village Hostel,,"To begin with, we made a reservation for 6 people in 4-people-per-dorm rooms. Finally, we were given a 4-people room and the other 2 got upgraded into a 2-people private room. Each room has its ensuite bathroom. My friend and I stayed in the 2-people private room.

We took the BART from SFO Airport to Powell station, and that took us 1/2 hour and USD 8.25. Right off the station, come up to Forever 21/Gap that street, walk it up (the cable car line), turn left, walk further up and Orange Village Hostel's signboard will be in view.

A point to note. Usually, a 10% deposit it made during the reservation. Then, the remaining 90% will be paid upon check-in. We paid USD 96 per person for a 3-nights stay, and that's meant for the 4-people room. It includes accommodation, linen and towel (collected upon check-in for 4-people room and prepared beforehand for 2-people room), free WIFI, continental breakfast (think waffles and cereals), full kitchen facilities, in-room refrigerator and microwave oven, and... luggage storage for collection before 9pm on check-out day. The best extra that comes with all these inclusions for USD 32 a night is the fantastic service of the staff! They are very knowledgeable and ever ready to assist. We asked them to recommend us where to go for a good Asian dinner, and we really enjoyed ourselves at Izakaya Ninja (the kimchi fried rice was awesome). From there, we took a walk to AMC Van Ness for a movie, but that's besides the point. It's a really great value-for-money stay.

Anyway, the WIFI works excellently throughout the property. There were multiplugs in our 2-people room which was fantastic. Do note to bring the USA adaptors though. We really liked the room which had a pair of single beds and desks, together with a 3-drawer cabinet and an open wardrobe with hangers. We also had a TV that we did not use at all - it had to be adjusted and we were just too busy outside of the hostel. There was also a fridge and a microwave which we did not use as well. There was a wash-up area with a mirror and a sink, and yes, this is in the bedroom area. There was no airconditioning, but one could easily open the windows to welcome the cooling SF wind.

Now... the bathroom. It was really a great pity that the 2-people room was very spacious but the bathroom was tiny. Well, basically, it is just a toilet bowl and a shower beside, with not much space to maneuver around... and when in the shower, it is just a standing space. We found a strange smell from the bath area, and concluded that it came from the shower curtains which were probably quite old. There was plenty of space to place our soaps, which was good. The most critical issue in the bathroom was that the shower handle works in an opposite direction!! It caused us a lot of frustration on our first night and the first morning. Well, our flight was cancelled on our first day, and we had to wait many hours before we could finally arrive and check-in at OVH, and the really sickening part was that we could not have a warm bath (the water was icy cold at night). We informed the staff during that very night and he said he would turn the heater on for us and told us to wait a few minutes. Who knows, the water remained icy cold! Then, the following morning, it was still icy cold! We went for breakfast and followed up with another female staff who quickly advised us that some handles worked in the opposite direction, i.e. the COLD part would be HOT, vice versa. Viola! That solved our frustration and from then on, we had decent baths....... Please keep it in mind that some bathrooms on the 5th floors would have this issue.

As for getting around, OVH is just steps from Macy's and Union Square. It takes about a 15-minutes walk to Chinatown from OVH, about 10-minutes walk to Civic Centre, and about 5-minutes walk to Union Square/Geary Street area. There was a Ruby Sparks nightclub which had long queues during the weekend we were there. The walls in the room were not that good for soundproof and we could definitely hear the TV from the next room and traffic sounds from downstairs. I am not a light sleeper so that was not much of an issue for me. We were tired and fell asleep naturally anyway. Back to location access, well, for Mission District (to see murals), one could easily take the MUNI trains for about USD 1.75 per ride. For Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Lombard Street, one can easily take the public bus which costs only USD 2 per person, and the ticket can be kept to take other buses until it expires. For those more keen in commentaries and hearing facts and jokes, they could take those hop-on and hop-off buses (there are at least 5 such operators in SF) which have stops close by OVH, e.g. Hilton Hotel and Union Square.

This hostel is really fantastic, and they were sold out on the weekend we were there... So, do book early. I probably wouldn't return unless I was doing backpacking or on a tight budget, but it's a great bargain hostel/stay for budget-conscious travellers.",6/1/2013,4,Friends
Orange Village Hostel,,"The orange village hostel is a nice little hostel a bit north of the taylor/Market st. bus and streetcar stop (and not far away from the powell/market metro station).

One thing to know is that the neighborhood to the west of it is not the nicest but when you go east from it, you are actually in a very good location. You're about 2 blocks away from the world famous cable cars (to the east of the hostel) and in a good location to get busses/metros to about everywhere.

The private rooms are really ok (they even have a microwave, fridge, private bathroom and tv with great programms) and generally clean. Staff is mostly nice, breakfast is nice too, but often overcrowded (especially during weekeds). The airport shuttle is also a nice service, picking you up in front of the hostel and bringing you to your terminal for 13$ per person, at any time of your choosing.

In any case there is someone on the front desk 24/7 and you have to be buzzed into the building so it was very secure. An added bonus that they offered a free breakfast.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Stayed here in May 2019, met so many cool people and had the best time! By far the most social hostel I've stayed in the US - definitely a rare find. There are hostels out there that are cheaper or more comfortable, but if you're looking for a proper European-like hosteling experience, I seriously doubt you'd find a better place in SF.",5/1/2019,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I booked the Green Tortoise Hostel for a one-night stay for $47. It’s best to book on their website as not all travel sites have access to their full inventory. The place is a very social & party headquarters, so this may not be the best selection for those expecting to get quality sleep every night. At check-in payment with credit card incurs a $1fee/night, so best to pay cash or use a debit card. There is a $20 key return deposit upon check-in. There are multiple bed rooms, so inquire for a room with fewer (4 vs 8) beds. Guests tend to be under 30 yrs. old. It is a non-smoking facility. **The reception is located on the second floor and there are no elevators. 

One thing that really impressed me was their info corner. This corner offered one of the best cheat sheets of TO DO/TO GO lists of any property I have ever stayed and this includes five star hotel properties. These little sheets, for example, listed FAQ’s, local foods, local coffee shops, local bars, a brewery list, and more. Each little sheet was pre-cut, so you could just grab it and go. The sheets listed hours for the businesses, clientele, mapped the area, favorite items to purchase at these businesses along with price categories. A simple idea, but excellent information source for all guests.

Room:
The rooms were probably a bit more dated, but still comfortable. The 4-bunk rooms were tight, but functional. Beds come with a reading light, power outlet, large storage area for each unit under the bunks. I was able to get my large suitcase under the bunk, just remember to bring your own lock. Linen is provided. I happen to be in a co-ed room.

Amenities:
Free Wi-Fi, free breakfast (07.30-10), pool tables/games, entertainment, lobby massage chairs, huge ball-room, computer lounge, laundry room, community kitchen and fridge storage, coffee/tea, and numerous free dinner nights in the community kitchen during the week. Check the activities board for numerous events each night of the week in-house and around the city. There is a sauna for guests by request only.

Overall, the place is a bit more dated and the rooms can be cramped but the hostel certainly offers one of the best activity calendars of any of the SF hostels I have booked in the past. The staff is efficient and very friendly. More mature guests may want to take into account the youthful activities and events and may want to consider other hostels.",5/1/2018,4,Solo

Reception staff are often heard socialising amongst themselves, felt like I was interrupting them! Only reason we would knock a point off.

Rooms are good with clean bed and sheets. Clean washrooms. Every evening new activity. Very nice ball room to hangout and eat. Pool table is an additional fun.

Only drawback was kitchen utensils hygiene. Probably when I was there the washing area tap was not fixed properly. Utensils were all sticky even after wash. If you provide free food then can make sure utensils are neat and clean.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I stayed at Green Tortoise for four days. I chose a hostel as I was travelling solo after a long time and wanted people around me. As a working professional I also wanted a place where I could work or use the computer if I wanted to. Green Tortoise was the perfect choice. The staff, like 70% of the people who choose to stay there were quite young. And very friendly. As there is no elevator,they helped me carry my luggage up. Then about the rooms,the dorms have bunk beds and a washbasin too. The basin is quite useful as you can use it when the common washrooms-cum-showers are occupied. The rooms are fairly neat, but the overall infrastructure is a bit old. They have fun themes on different nights. You get free breakfast everyday and on some nights too. If you buy food, you can label and refrigerate in their fridge. Bottom shelves usually have free food you can eat anytime of the day. It can range from salads and meal boxes to leftover cooked the night before. Location wise too it's quite central and has Italian restaurants around. They let me pack free food in their boxes and take it when I had to rush for a tour. They also have massage chairs and a dry sauna room that you can use for free. I felt a little grown up for bunk beds and the very young vibe, but also happy I stayed here as it was hassle free and super friendly. Would surely stay again.

They have different events and free dinners or (friday?). It's a good chance to socialize. 

I will mention, if you are staying in a dorm, make sure you bring a lock for your in-room storage locker. I would have but I wasn't planning on staying in a hostel. They do have ones for purchase (5 bucks) if you forget. Towels are $1. I like the dry sauna (you sign up for it) The location is pretty decent. Not far from Chinatown.

Free breakfast was a nice plus.

We booked a shared double-bed room both nights. This was an unusual experience for us as new-comers to hostels and we generally we happy with it. When we arrived, it was quite late as our flight arrived in the evening and we then got the subway into the city and had to navigate to the hostel. As a result, when we arrived into our room, the lights were off and a couple were asleep right infront of the door. As a result, we stirred them from their sleep and felt terrible. Of course, we just weren't used to this situation and were trying our best to not make any noise. As we were on the top bunk, it was impossible to get up and down without making noise as the bed was quite creaky. However, once we adapted it was fine. On the returning night we had the bottom bunk which was a lot better and we preferred this. 

The bathrooms were great, and we only had to wait for a short while for a shower. The food options were good, but didn't leave us full up. The dining room system works well, everyone helps themselves and cleans up after themselves. The wifi is good and helped us keep in touch with family. All of the staff were super friendly and helpful, as were all of the other visitors to the hostel. There was lovely atmosphere and we would definitely stay again. 

The hostels location is fine, a short walk away from the main tourist destinations. Golden Gate Bridge is a long walk away but the hostel provide lots of information about transport. They also have maps for you to revise or buy. 

Overall, it was a very positive experience and made our trip to California a lot more fun!",7/1/2018,4,Couple
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I love the Green Tortoise! I recently stayed at this hostel during my weeklong adventure In San Francisco. In a word.... STUPENDOUS! The staff (aka Tortoises <3) are welcoming and warm! Daily activities and community dinner on Monday/Wednesday/Friday - Be sure to volunteer! The rooms are clean and serviced often by dedicated staff. Private bathrooms and laundry available and also free wifi!!

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I've typically stayed in hostels in Europe and Asia, not so much in the states. But this is a great option if you're looking to save some cash on sleeping in San Francisco. The amenities are good, clean, and the dining hall is incredible. The only small negative comment I would give is that I paid for a 6 bedroom female dorm, and when I arrived at the room I was actually sleeping on the bay window as the 7th person. I guess when in San Francisco!? Met some other lovely solo female travelers in my room.",10/1/2018,4,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I've been here three times. Once in 2014, once in 2015, and once more in 2018. Good times were had each time. They really are delightful, very social and friendly, and very clean. People from all over the world stay here. They have many options for stays that include private rooms, dorms, triples, etc. They also do dinners every monday wednesday and friday that people are encouraged to help prepare and then everyone gets to enjoy regardless. I'm something of a picky eater, so I didn't have much of these dinners, but it's still a lovely way to get people to gather. Their cook, who gives speeches during the dinners, is quite a character. They are really nicely located, you can walk straight to the piers and the Exploratorium(which I love) pretty easily. Pier 39 and 41 are a distance away, though. Some good pizza is a few blocks away and there is a place that makes excellent wings that is close enough to deliver. Just all around excellent. They have some policies that are kind of annoying but also make sense, like not allowing food or drink in the rooms. Bathrooms are a bit packed in the mornings. Regardless, a beautiful place in a beautiful city. Recommend any day of the week. Five stars! ALL THE STARS. (I only give a four on service because of some less than ideal experience with the cleaning lady not coming back to clean our room when we said we'd be out in five minutes. They also just choose odd times to do the cleaning, it seems(though sometimes I choose odd times to sleep).",11/1/2018,5,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"The main hostel itself runs good events and is kept clean. Unfortunately I was situated in rooms a block away in a separate building they own. The security was appalling as a man who was not staying at the hostel was allowed to sleep in the kitchen, he smoked drugs all night and used the facilities meant for guests. This resulted in my constantly carrying my valuables around out of fear he would steal them. When I asked reception to remove the man the guy on reception was uninterested, rude and gave appalling customer service. Only after I sent a horrible emailing threatening to take the matter did I receive an apology and a refund for one of my nights. If you get a room in the main hostel then your visit should be ok. If you room is in the separate building I'd look at cancelling your stay here.",11/1/2018,2,Solo

Best things there are still the musical instruments to use and play with your friends or people who you just met and even a (dry) sauna. Maybe my best hostel experience and I have visited a couple. 

Even if it looks a little old, it is more far away from many attractions and not everything is in perfect condition, it definitely was worth the money! (well, ended up extending my stay with two days even I had paid the another night in another hostel...)",11/1/2018,4,Friends

The dining room lends itself to meeting other travellers of all ages and nationalities which for me defines wayfaring.

This year's stay on Halloween included an evening tostada bar which preceded a pub crawl through selected watering holes in North Beach. The North Beach neighborhood provides some excellent walking with viable access to downtown and the water front.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"You need to know what to expect, but at half the price of hotels in the area, the Green Tortoise is a great option. The rooms are small, but clean; the shared bathrooms likewise.

All of the staff were extremely welcoming and attentive. There's a free breakfast every morning, good WiFi, and it's located in a pretty great location. Walk only a block in any direction and you'll find something worth seeing, or more importantly, eating or drinking. The hostel IS nearly surrounded by strip clubs, but we never felt unsafe or uncomfortable. 

Branding itself as a 'party hostel', you'd expect the average age to be pretty low, but there were plenty of older folk during our two-night stay, and even a family or two. They have nightly outings, but we were never kept up by loud music playing into the night or the like. That said, the walls are pretty damn thin, so make sure you bring earplugs!

We visited in October, but I imagine it could be pretty sweaty in Summer. Our room only started cooling down a couple of hours after sunset.",10/1/2018,5,Couple

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Green Tortoise was great. Everything a hostel should be. Hotel taxes, etc. make San Francisco not the cheapest city for hostels. GT makes up for it with the free massive breakfast, the weekday free dinners and general good+safe vibes. I also liked that the clientele wasn't all 19 year olds looking to get wasted, but if you're looking for that vibe, they were able to provide that too with nightly outings. Location is near a bunch of touristy things (SF is not huge, lots is walkable from the hostel), sort of traditionally seedy neighborhood, but the hostel felt safe nevertheless. A stone's throw from City Lights Bookstore. Sj at the front desk was super friendly, conversational, accommodating :)",9/1/2018,5,Business
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"The green tortoise was a great choice by my friend. There are a few hostels in SF but this one was perfect. Nice location for a bunch of attractions (trolley tracks are a few blocks away, the piers are a few blocks away, financial district is a few blocks away, “Lombard street” is probably a mile away, GG bridge is about 3.5 miles away). 
If coming from airport by the train (BART), get off at Montgomery Station and walk a few blocks there. It will cost about $10 from the airport to get there by train. 
The hostel has activities every day. Free dinner Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Free breakfast everyday. Almost every day the hosts walk around town collecting sandwiches, salads and pastries from local business that they are going to have to throw away the food at the end of the night. So the hosts collect this food and give it to the guests for free. Even on the non-free dinner days. It’s a very generous and free spirited hostel. Everyone is very friendly.",8/1/2018,5,Friends

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"It's a nice little place to stay short-term. The service was excellent, and staff were friendly. The bathrooms were clean. But in my opinion, what really makes or break your experience here is the people that you end up sharing a room with. There can be some sketchy individuals but it's not that bad overall. It's expected that you will have be adapt to the others in your room (people in and out, moving things around, snoring, etc.). It's probably best to bring earplugs. My belongs felt secure and safe as they have lockers under the bed. 
The area isn't bad either, it can be noisy outside - especially on the weekends but it's safe as there's usually lots of people hanging around. Buses are close by, and a lot of the tourist places are in walk-able distance (Fisherman's Wharf. Chinatown, Financial District, etc.).

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Never staying in a hostel before, I had my doubts. I envisioned the shared bathrooms to have several toilets and showers and no privacy. I expected (at least) slightly dirty conditions and run-down rooms. Not! The restrooms are private, each having its own toilet, sink and shower, they lock from the inside so it's all yours while you are in there. And they are very clean and roomy.
I chose a private room, feel I'm a little too old for dorm room style accommodations. It included a sink, and was also very clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. There were several free movies to choose from, tho I never did. 
The building itself is very old, but the accommodations are pretty modern. There are alot of stairs - no elevator - first flight up gets you to reception, then 1 or more flights to get up to the rooms. They have free breakfast every morning, including eggs you make yourself if you like, bagels, toast, fruit, yogurt, etc. 3 nights a week they make free dinners, plus all nights we were there they gathered sandwiches, salads, etc. from nearby delis for us to eat, also for free. 
The staff were super friendly & helpful! Yes, the location may not be ideal for some (strip clubs nearby) but overall had a good feel to it. It definitely felt safe during the daytime. We never went out at night so can't comment on that.

It is close to a lot of the bars on Broadway which provided us with very different vibes - great beers all around. The staff was very helpful and provided us with a lot of personal recommendations which added a personal touch. There is a good amount of security as well, you have to show your landyard key as soon as you walk in to ensure you are a resident of the hostel. It was also very reasonably priced for the location. Upon arriving, there is a spot to park your car for up to 15 minutes for you to unload your belongings and the hostel has a deal with a local (about 500m away) covered parking garage for $40 for 2 nights which is very convenient!

My only drawback is that each floor only has 5/6 bathrooms with showers and toilets. This means first thing in the morning it can be difficult to find a bathroom. It would be better if there were a couple of toilets as well as just mini bathrooms with shower and toilet in one.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I stayed at the Green Tortoise a few years ago and had an awesome experience. I’ve since recommended it to lots of friends and family and they have all stayed. So when I had two nights in SF I straight away booked here again. 

We had a rough day and our two flights were delayed and we arrived at the hostel just after 2am (I had emailed the staff to let them know in advance) we arrived to the hostel and got our bags inside and my partner waited at the bottom of the stairs as I went to check in. 

As soon as I got to the top of the stairs I was yelled at by the receptionist “don’t kick our doors”....I was baffled and told her I hadn’t done anything to the door other then bump it with my large suitcase. Which she snapped back “you kicked it, I watched you!”. 

We were off to a great start and it only got worse. 

The receptionist VELL was rude, condescending, and incredibly unwelcoming. She snapped at me for asking her legitimate questions and gave sarcastic remarks. At this point my partner (who was down the bottom of the stairs) heard the way she was speaking to me and came up. He was also greeted with the same foul attitude. After snapping at us and taking my payment she said “room 36, go right, left, right” and threw the keys on the counter. No explanation of the facilities or perks this hostel offers. 

Then the following morning we were leaving early (5am) and the same staff member was sitting at the desk...scowling at us as we walked past, not so much as a smile or hello. 

We have been traveling all over the States and Canada for 12 weeks and this is the WORST customer service, hands down, we’ve ever encountered. 
Vell - you are in the wrong line of work and the Green Tortoise should be ashamed to have someone like that on their otherwise great & friendly team. 

We stayed in a private room, it’s was on the 3rd floor and was adequate. Bed was not the greatest but did the job. The bathrooms are great and they even offer shampoo/conditioner/soap. 
We didn’t eat at the breakfasts as our schedule didn’t allow but in my past stay it was great.

The staff at the hostel were all super-welcoming, and the gorgeous front-desk person Jo was gracious enough to listen and laugh to my teenager's jokes for about an hour in the evening.

Yes, it is a hostel and, yes, it is a slightly frayed building, but there was nothing objectionable in either of those things. The building had character and was kept spotlessly clean. Yes, the main bulk of those staying are younger (i.e. below 30), but there were plenty of people, like me and my travel buddy, who were more mature in age (40s, 50s +, even families). You can get involved with the daily social events if you like - even help out in preparing the free breakfast and evening meals - or you can just relax in the large, grand communal hall with a book and watch the world go by. The were plenty of people doing the latter and the whole atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. Our private room was a little small, but it had all the facilities we needed and even our own sink. The staff were friendly and very helpful. There is even a laundry on site, free massage chairs and a sauna. The reception has lots of useful information you can take away, whether it be the best local cafes, or bars, tourists spots etc. There are also many PCs that are free to use in a separate seating area.

Not a bad location, good choice of free breakfast and free hot drinks all day.

Really high bunk beds, almost fell off coming down! 
Big good size kitchen but the down side was that there wasnt enough mugs around especially in the mornings if you wanted a cup of tea! The milk also had bits in.. which put me of my tea! 
The dining area is massive but feels like it could be updated too. 
There is only 1 toilet in the lobby area and with a big hostel and many guests i feel that this is not enough and you usually end up queuing!
Also there is only 5 bathrooms on each level.. the floor i was on had 4 as one was being renovated and even then i dont think thats enough. It would help if the toilets were seperated with the showers. But what can you do. I liked the different bathroom styles though! 
I didnt feel like the staff were that friendly. 

A lot of information on how to get around to visit the attractions were helpful. However i just walked everywhere and improved my map reading skills ha! 

The pillow is so flat and hard and the duvet cover doesnt actually get washed which is a bit eww.

There was also an assortment of old well used guitars to play before hitting the pavement. Also, very nice.The layout was simple for adequate to fuel up for a day of walking the city. Now, the North Beach location, a few steps away from the intersection of Kearny and Broadway is excellent as I like the neighborhood. My literary themed walk took me to City Lights Books and Cafe Trieste where I communed with the ghostly presence of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and the other beats. Yes, I will stay at the Tortoise again.",5/1/2018,5,Solo

I booked an all-girls dorm room and got the lower bunk bed(I had requested for the same prior to coming to SF). They had good breakfast options, with bagels (choice of spread- cheese/butter/peanut butter), juices, milk, eggs that you cook by yourself. 
One thing that I liked was that they already mentioned on their site about the noise that would be there at night from the street. Location of the hostel is perfect, very near to Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Telegraph hill, etc.
The only thing that was a concern(just on the very first day because I had not expected it) was that though the hostel was centrally located, the block it was on was full of strip clubs. It got ok the following day because expectation was now set :)

I was traveling on my own, the front desk staff are super friendly and happy to answer any questions and made me feel very comfortable. I ended up extending my stay by an extra 3 days because it was so great.

There are activities on every night to help you meet people in the hostel where you can get cheap food and drinks (this is especially good in a city as expensive as SF), The common area is awesome and is also set up to help you make friends. There are free meals 3 nights a week which you can (and should) volunteer to help prepare. I met some of the best people at the hostel when I did this. The leftovers are also kept in the fridge to provide free meals the day after which is so great for backpacking on a budget.

It is in a great location close to Downtown, China Town, Little Italy and Fisherman's wharf.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Unfortunately I can only give Green Tortoise a 2☆, and this is just due to the friendly staff and their help in resolving issues.

We had booked for 4 nights and were given a private room in the seperate building a couple of blocks down from the main building. The room was small but what we expecting.

The problem was when we woke up the next morning. Despite there being a notice in the kitchen that sometimes ants can appear in the shower due to warm weather we were not expecting them to be in our room. We woke to find ants in our bed and crawling along the skirting board, bedside table and walls. If it was just a few it would have been fine, however it was a shock to see how many there were and some had got into our suitcase. 

We spoke to Tony early that morning and he was very helpful and refunded the rest of our stay. We were given 50% refund for the one night we had stayed after asking management if they would consider a refund.

Potentially may consider staying in the future, but it was not an ideal stay for me and my fiancé, who were visiting SF as the first leg of a 5 week stay in the US.",9/1/2017,2,Couple

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"The Green Tortoise is largely a place for the younger folks, ones who are generally more agreeable to bunk room situations. I'm not, but the Green Tortoise does have about five single rooms in a separate building, just a couple of blocks from the main building. I chose one of those room. The bed was comfortable and the sharing the bath was not an issue.

My room had two large windows that opened. I love that! With a double / queen bed in a room designed for something smaller, it was a little tough getting out of your own way, but I understand that putting in the larger bed probably makes more sense. There was a box fan in the room, but it was not needed. Just as well because it was filthy. I have little patience for neglected and very obvious maintenance items. 

The bath has a rod that holds three rolls of toilet paper. All were empty, and there was a separate roll on the windowsill. I had noticed the afternoon before that the rolls were empty. I think we can agree that's a big no-no. 

Check-in was easy and friendly. Since the room was in a separate building, someone walked me over to it. There was a (big sigh) tip jar on the check-in counter! No, no, no, i'm not going to tip you for checking me in! For a place like the Green Tortoise, who goes to lengths to be fun, the presence of a tip jar for checking you in is a mite pretentious. (If the place were the Hotel Costa Plenty, instead of the Green Tortoise, I'd be equally annoyed.) 

I was looking forward to the breakfast in the morning - the ""hostel feel"". Everyone had to cook their own breakfast. Maybe there were other items to cook, but all I saw were eggs. After cooking your breakfast, then you clean the dishes you just used. Even with just four or five people cooking or cleaning, it was literal case of ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" I found it terribly impractical and very poorly laid out. Even small considerations such as ""where is a cup for the coffee?"" was more challenging than it needed to be.",9/1/2017,3,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I had a great stay at the green tortoise. There were many social events but the rooms were calm - when I didn't partake I got a good night's sleep.

Also towel hire is only $1!
Location ok - sometimes felt a little unsafe at night but central, busy and quite a lot of buses around.",9/1/2017,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Green Tortoise is in an excellent location; very central to all the attractions, shops and food. Front house staff were always very friendly and helpful. 

We stayed in a private room which is in a different building - less than 5 minutes down the road from the main building. It is actually a multi-storey house, very homely and welcoming. Frankly, it was very much like staying in an Airbnb. Our room was spacious and the bathroom and kitchen were always very clean (which is cleaned daily). No issues with sharing the bathroom as there were only 2 rooms on our floor. You don't hear any traffic noise from the room so this would be very ideal for those who need a restful sleep. The bed was extremely comfortable! 

For breakfast, we had to walk back to the main building. It was the usual fare of bagels/toast, juice, cereal, yogurt and the option of cooking your own eggs. Good enough to fuel up before the start of the day. I really liked their dish-washing system which saves lots of water and time!

My only negative feedback would be that the staff could have responded more promptly to our email enquiries prior to our trip. After booking our room, I did not receive an email confirmation for our booking. It took a phone call to them to finally confirm our booking as our emails went unanswered. 

Overall however, we had a very restful and lovely time at Green Tortoise. I highly recommend booking their private room if you would like a more privacy and for a more restful time overall. I would not hesitate to come back!",8/1/2017,4,Couple

Serve a good free breakfast too. 
The room was adequate, what you would expect from a hostel. Shared bathroom can be a pain, especially if your waiting to get in the shower or use the toilet! The bathrooms though were surprisingly clean! The hostel itself is a bit grubby. We paid a lot of money to stay here, was actually our most expensive stop along the west coast, including Vegas.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"My girlfriend and I stayed in a private room here for a week. In short, we agreed that overall this is the best hostel we've stayed in ever, and we've stayed in about 40 over the years. What makes this hostel so good is that it has the organization and efficiency of the best large hostels while still having a lot of character. Plus, it's in a great location.

Like I said, we stayed in a private room, specifically the ""bird's nest"" which is basically a room on the roof of the hostel. I don't know if you can request that room specifically, but definitely take it if you have the chance. You basically have a roof balcony all to yourself. The room had a lot of character, too, with a mural of the city skyline on the wall.

The common areas are all very clean and comfortable. There are 10 or so singe-person bathrooms, which can get full, but since there are so many you don't have to wait on a long line. 

There is a large room on the main floor where they serve breakfast and dinner and I think some performances. What's great about that room it keeps the rest of the hostel surprisingly quiet. The free dinner was better than I expected, so check it out if you can tear yourself away from all the good Chinese and Italian food nearby.

Speaking of which, the location is great. We've been to SF a few times, and I think this is the ideal place to stay, especially now with Lyft and Uber as options. There are also many bus lines that are nearby, but Lyft/Uber lets you avoid the more complicated public transportation routes. Plus, you're less than a mile walk from most of the tourist destinations. 

You have Chinatown on one side and great Italian food on the other side. Both are worth multiple meals. There are also several bars nearby. There are also the ""adult"" venues nearby, but it's not a big deal since there is a lot more going on in the area, day and night.

People working there are all friendly and professional. In addition to the desk, which usually has 3 or so people working, you'll see people cleaning and maintaining the kitchen throughout the day.",7/1/2017,5,Couple

They organize a lot of activities going out in the city, so it's a really good place to stay as a solo traveler.

Also, San Francisco can be pretty expensive, so the free dinners every other night are suuuper welcome. They served this Mexican food bar one of the nights I stayed there that was particularly delicious. The dining area is this big open old ballroom, and it seemed like basically the whole hostel is there. One night they had some live music, which was cool.

I had some pretty bad sleeps due to the uncomfortable mattress (felt more like a boxspring) and a cacophony of snores from other guests (I was in an 8 person dorm). Of course, snoring can't be controlled by the hostel, but something to remember when staying in a hostel.

I recommend you to help out with the dinner with the chief on (Monday/Wednesdat/ Friday)! You will then get to meet other people and have fun cooking with them. I got the window bed which was really cool because I got a good view.

I had a private room in a separate building to the main one. Just 2 blocks up the road.
Whilst it served a purpose, double bed, tv, clean(ish) shared bathroom, clean shared kitchen, ok breakfast, I didn't feel it was value for money compared to USA hostels in union square.
The gentleman at check in was great and helpful but the girl on check was very rude.

Service was always friendly and the location is an easy walk to so many attractions. If you are considering booking a private room in this building I would recommend asking for a room on the third floor (so long as you don't mind hauling your luggage upstairs) because rooms on the second and third floor have more windows and I suspect on the third they'd have a great view of the Bay Bridge",2/1/2017,5,Couple

The employees were always very helpful with any questions we had about the city or anything we needed. The best part, however, was the activities that the hostel had planned every night. They serve free dinner three nights of the week, and every night there's a different activity you can participate in.

While the price for a bed may be higher than what you are used to internationally, it's what you would expect from most hostels in the US, at least for decent ones. Either way, San Francisco had the highest average hotel prices in the world this past year, so your money is well-spent at this hostel, no doubt. The location is great and I find myself walking to most locations if the weather permits, or there is a BART station relatively close. There are plenty of good restaurants and fun bars nearby, so entertainment options are endless. While I only participated once due to already made plans, the hostel often has events such as bar crawls, tours, free daily breakfast and free dinners throughout the week.

Or maybe everyday. 

If you are hippies and love to do fun activities, this is your place. However you have to take note that there are a lot of night life place nearby, you may want to take note note to wander around in the night time though it should be quite safe.

The free breakfast and dinner really cut my spending costs and were a great help! Plus, they were delicious! It is an older building, but I think there's something to appreciate about the style of it. I like how it doesn't look super modern because it makes it have a fun and unique atmosphere. They have live music, daily activities, and fun games! They also emphasize recycling and reusing, which I applaud! The only thing I would suggest is that there be soap placed in the dorm rooms (there are sinks in the dorms for brushing teeth and etc.) Otherwise, thanks for a wonderful stay, Green Tortoise! *Below is a picture of me and a hostel friend :)",11/1/2016,5,Solo

You can hang out in the ballroom where there are games, music, tables, a full kitchen where you can store food, make coffee or tea. Every night they have some sort of event, whether it be beer pong or free dinner. The room itself we shared with two other women, bunk bed style. The lockers are big enough to fit your suitcases in, just bring a lock. You rent a towel for a dollar. There are 5 bathrooms per floor that are all private and vary in size. Try to shower early or at night because sometimes there is a line. The beds are comfy enough to sleep in. The room had a sink which is great. There is no elevator so be prepared to drag your suitcases upstairs. Plenty of computers and lounge chairs. A bike rack room. They even cut you a deal for airport shuttles, $10. The area itself is near Chinatown and the strip clubs, but is completely safe in comparison to mission street and market street. Plenty of restaraunts and bars nearby.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"This is my first 5 star review of any hotel I have ever stayed in, and the Green Tortoise Hostel (GTH) earned it in absolutely every way. Now, I have stayed in much nicer hotels over the years, but the first question that needs to be answered when giving a 5-star review would be; did it exceed my expectations. And in that regard, it is an emphatic YES.

This is a hostel, not a hotel, and there are important differences. Essentially, you're paying to stay in a shared community space. There are private rooms available, but I stayed in a bunk-bed style room with other travelers. Sheets are provided, but you must either bring your own towel or pay to 'rent' one. There are lockers under each bed, and same deal, bring your own lock or buy one of theirs. Standard hostel fare. You can also store larger luggage in the secure staff office, and they have an indoor bike rack.

The bed, while just a twin (because bunk beds) was surprisingly nice, and honestly better than many hotels I have stayed at. Sheets were very clean, as was the rest of the hostel.

There is a common area in the lobby with multiple free-use computers. The main ballroom is actually stunning, with 20 foot ceilings and a great view of the Transamerica Pyramid. I guess it used to be an old Italian restaurant. It makes for a great place to hang out any time of day. 

The GTH staff is very friendly and extremely well organized, and that's really what sets this place apart. They run a tight ship and keep everything clean and safe. The No Outside Guest policy is pretty reassuring if you're concerned about safety.

Breakfast is offered every morning, with some snacks and pastries offered throughout the week, all included. There's also dinner 3 nights a week! You can also make your own food in their industrial kitchen and keep food/drinks in their many fridges. I highly encourage eating at least a couple meals there and meeting your fellow travelers from around the globe.

The bathrooms are also all private. Each room contains a shower, toilet, and sink which is very handy to get ready in the morning.

I would definitely recommend bringing ear plugs to sleep, as the street outside can get very noisy at all hours, but it really wasn't a big issue for me.

There may be some tiles missing or some scuffs on the walls, but honestly I cannot possibly recommend GTH enough based on the staff and the wonderful sense of community they have fostered in this very special place.",10/1/2016,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"There are a lot of things to love about Green Tortoise: the kitchen's awesome, as is the included breakfast, and the free dinner system (even on days when there aren't free dinners, there was usually a box of leftover edible things up for grabs). And the lavender-scented products in the showers are great! Ditto for location: City Lights is literally on the doorstep.

Downsides: I paid for a bunk bed in a dorm, and was presented with a window sill. Quite literally. The hostel was at maximum capacity, so I have the feeling maybe they were trying their luck? But, guys, seriously, give the poor people you put on the sill a discount! It was half the size of a single bunk bed, rock solid, and almost unbearably loud, on account of being...in the window. 

Also: you are specifically instructed to strip the sheet off your mattress, but not the case off your duvet (comforter) when you leave. Which I assume means duvet covers are transferred between guests? I've never come across this in hostels before, and I think it's a little gross, to be honest.

The fullness of the hostel also meant there was never, ever not a queue for the bathroom, seemingly at whatever time I tried. I know it's hard with old buildings, but I feel like having toilets separate from the showers could really speed things up here (I was in town for a conference, so it was kind of stressful, worrying whether I'd be able to wash in time).

Finally, the staff were a bit of a mixed bag. Most were solidly friendly, but one in particular was consistently really rude - I had a similar instance to one someone else spelled out here, of having to go back and look through a bag I left behind reception on the day I checked out. I had misplaced my money, was travelling solo, was going through my backpack and slightly freaking out, when a member of staff came up and deadpan told me to go move my bag somewhere else, so she didn't have to watch me. I explained the crisis, apologised, and clearly had my bag in a not very moveable state. She said nothing, stared at me, and watched as I made three separate trips plus stuff to round the front of the check in desk. She then sat down, in the room where I'd just been, at a table with a clear view of where I'd been going through the bag. I do get security concerns with guests + left luggage, but the way she went about it struck me as unnecessarily hostile and - at that point in time - kind of upsetting.",10/1/2016,3,Business

The facilities around the hostel were good, and the staff friendly enough apart from 1 member of staff who seemed continuously angry at the world!

The 1 thing that did really make our stay great was the fact the hostel was very well set up for it's guests to socialise despite the fact they could have done a lot more to organise social events like bar crawls etc the vibe was fantastic.

Free breakfast and free dinner on Tuesday and Wednesday only.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Me and my wife recently stayed the hostel as part of a whistle-stop three day tour of San Francisco and were not left disappointed.

Naturally, it being a hostel our worries were security, cleanliness and standard of room and all points were covered fantastically well by a fabulously fun yet hotel-like hostel.

We stayed in the Birds Nest room, which we were told had been recently decorated by one of the staff and the best way to describe it would be a garden shed on the top of the building. That description however does not do justice to the beautiful mural painted on the wall inside and the cosy, comfortable and surprisingly well fixtured room.

Shared bathrooms were almost always vacant and in a great state of repair and cleanliness and for this I think the place should take a great deal of pride.

The security at the hostel was basic, yet effective with a curfew in place of 8pm for the doors to be locked and a system whereby you should show your key on arrival at the desk post this time.

We did not engage with the activities organised by the hostel as we had a rigid itinery in place due to the nature of our brief visit, but there were activities arranged for every night to keep even the most socially active traveller busy.

In short, The Green Tortoise has managed a difficult proposition by combining the carefree, fun-loving nature of hostel living with keeping a hotel-like comfort and security, and done so quite amazingly.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"My wife and I first stayed here 20 years ago at the start of a road trip around South West USA. Since then, we've returned to San Francisco a few times - mostly with our sons when they were between the ages of 1-12. It's a rambling, fairly shabby building, with a 'dining room' and kitchen that's been in varying degrees of (dis)repair on each visit. There are meals served a couple of times a week and everyone does their own dishes. There are showers and toilets on each floor. The rooms are mostly dorms, but we've always booked a private room. This became less comfortable the larger our children got, as the rooms are not large. It's mostly clean and there's a genuine charm to the place that's hard not to like (unless you dislike hostels backpackers). When we first stayed here, our private room cost less than some awful hotels we've stayed in in Europe, and it's still one of the cheapest places to stay in San Francisco. If your minimum standard is a high class hotel or guesthouse, you won't be considering staying here. If, like us, you love the youthful atmosphere and excitement of North Beach and don't mind roughing it a bit, you'll probably love it. The staff are generally very helpful and there's someone on the desk all day and night.",5/1/2016,5,Family

Well located, near Chinatown (where you can do your grocery), Telegraph Hill, Fisherman's Wharf, Columbus Avenue which is a nice street! Activites are organized everyday, you can register if you want. The Hostel is also a travel adventure agency, you can book some tours with them if you want to visit Yosemite Park or even more.

There is free dinner on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Dinners are very gooood! Leftover are also often available. Free food will be available sometimes in the dinning room (which is pretty big!). Kitchen is large and nice. The bathrooms are very clean and are all private (some with showers other only toilet). Free breakfast is worth it. You can make your own eggs and there is always hot beans ready, bagels, fruits, yogourt and oat. Of course, coffee and tea. Great breakfast!

This is a very big Hostel. Approx 40 rooms. Hence, I found the Hostel was missing that ""Hostel vib"" that you find in smaller ones (like Seb B mentioned). I mean, you don't feel like your being a family with the people there. You don't get to know everyone, often, people won't stay long. You feel more like being in a Hotel. I found people tend to be less easy to approach. The dinning room is so big, you almost feel like you're in a cafeteria. But again, it depends of your trip purpose, what are your expectations.

Great value for money, with the free breakfasts and free dinners every other night that were delicious...lots of maps and directions to certain points of interest available in reception to take, staff were helpful too. 

I never had to wait for a bathroom either and I noticed there was a sauna although I never used it. I stayed in a female dorm on the third floor and I was pleased to see it faced the street so had a great view and nice big windows that you could open right up...I noticed there were window beds too, request those if you fancy something a lil more charming than a bunk!
Real handy having power points next to your bed, wish all hostels had this!

I loved the old ballroom, and the character of the building too. Awesome place to stay if you're travelling solo too, you meet so many people. It was also a great help that the hostel has a deal with the airport shuttle companies, use this! 

The only negative is the lack of lifts! When you've been travelling for hours then have to lug all your luggage up 3 flights of stairs it's not the best welcome, but the positives outweigh this for sure.

The free breakfast was surprisingly decent and the staff were kind and helpful (for the most part) but having stayed in the Green Tortoise Hostel in Seattle recently, I was expecting something more from this one. As a result, it didn't quite live up to my expectation. I know that I shouldn't compare one hostel to another, but the reason why I decided to try this hostel in the first place was because I had a blast staying in the one in Seattle. That one was a FANTASTIC hostel, 4.5 stars out of 5, but this one... not so much (about 2.5 out of 5.) I also went to this dinner crawl thing and the tour guide was not very nice. It's not the worst hostel I've ever stayed, but I must say I was vastly disappointed. Find some place else if you can.",8/1/2016,3,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Loved this hostel! First time staying in a hostel we came for the outside lands music festival! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! I asked to change beds so I could be on the bottom bunk and they were more than accommodating.

The free breakfast helped save us some money and guests can change the music in the common area which was fun! Very clean and the bathrooms were nice, although sometimes there was a wait to use the restroom. 

The location is great since it's right in North beach. Walking distance to city lights bookstore. Be sure to grab a sandwich at Molanaries Deli and eat it in Washington Square park! Both which are extremely close. The parking garage they sent us to was friendly and discounted as well.

The staff even emailed me that I left my earrings in the room and sent them back to me! 

Would recommend! Definitely staying here again.",8/1/2016,5,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"We just finished the Yosemite tour with this company and were due to check in to another hostel later in the day. As we'd just camped for 3 nights and slept on a bus etc we really needed a freshen up and the tour guide offered everyone a day pass to use this hostel (where they drop us off) for $10 each.

For a hostel the facilities are incredible, the breakfast is served in a ballroom with plenty of seating and places to charge your equipment. The breakfast was either self cooked (they supplied eggs and kitchen equipment) or you can use their bagel toaster and choice of toppings (cream cheese, P&J etc). There's also cereal, orange juice and coffee available.

We used their laundry services which is 2 dollars each for wash and dry. They take quarters and there's a change machine in reception.

The showers are perfectly fine with a private toilet, although a little cramped for getting changes in.

Overall for a few hours R&R after a camping trip well worth the $10 - especially when we had about 4 bagels.",8/1/2016,5,Couple
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,Location is alright - it's within walking distance to Pier 39 but it is located in the red light district. Often heard drunk people on the streets late at night so might affect you if you're a light sleeper. Always had to wait to use a bathroom as there are only 5 single bathrooms per floor. Included breakfast was pretty average but it was free so can't complain. Staff were great and hostel offered lots of activities and 3 X free dinners a week which helped the budget. Overall would probably still stay again.,7/1/2016,3,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"When I first walked in here i thought omg what have i booked... but it was an incredible stay!! It is a old building and its not modern at all, after a while i got used to it though and it gave the place a great feel to it. Was nice to be in a not so modern building. The hostel provides great breakfast and free dinners a few nights a week. Had a great time helping cook them. Went out on a thai night with other people staying there. They are great at getting people together! Would defo stay here every time i go San Fran now! Also do some great tours which i new about previous would have loved to have done the Yosemite bus tour!",5/1/2016,5,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"We arrived at the hostel at approx. 12am, after a very long day of travelling from the UK feat. many delays and glasses of wine. Morale was low. The check in, however, was exceptionally easy, even though we arrived on 4th July and butchered the receptionists' party plans.

We stayed in a 5 bed female dorm which was ideal, although the ladders to the top bunk were somewhat hard to master. It was a quiet and light room with a sink, and their were enough bathrooms - so we never had to queue for the toilets or showers.

The chef is incredible - the free dinner they put on on Friday night was delicious and healthy - and vegan and gluten free, much to my friend's delight. Great free breakfast every morning too (they have a bagel slicer!!).

All in all, we had a great stay here. It seemed like there were fun activities for the party animals among us, but we were too busy to check them out unfortunately. We did however manage to go on one of their recommended wine tours, which was an excellent day out. Would very much stay again and recommend to any travellers!",7/1/2016,5,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I don't stay in motels often.. But we had to try save some money!! Green tortoise was one of the cheapest accommodation available and had the best reviews when we had done some research. 

The staff are friendly, the amenities are great!
Beds are clean, comfortable.... 
Pillows are thin-ish. Worth buying a cheap pillow and adding it on top of the one they provide if the one you use at home is bigger! 

Rooms are cleaned every day, bathroom and toilets are clean and although shared, easy to access. 

Washing machines and dryers are easy and not expensive. (There are some times during the day that they are reserved for staff to wash bedsheets etc) 

Free breakfast in the mornings, basic breads and jams etc, fruit, juice. Eggs are available in the kitchen if you want to cook them yourself. Main common area is big and welcoming. 

Lots of exciting things going on in the hostel if you want to join in, but if you're more the quiet type it's easy to enjoy your own company! Not too loud or anything. Met some really nice people in our dorm, some are a bit loud in the morning. But we don't mind too much :)

The facilties were clean and breakfast was free with a large variety of choice. I only stayed one night but from my experience it was a very social hostel. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"37 yr old solo female traveler. Like to site see and party - perfect location, friendly staff, clean for a hostel, strong wifi signal, plug sockets beside bed, large storage space (bring a padlock), lots of information for trips and local information, great atmosphere, if you want quiet or party it's all available. 
Every night there is something on and free dinners 3 nights a week. 
Would highly recommend. 

Points to note - no hand dryers or towels in bathrooms so you need to take your own towel every time you go to dry your hands, if you are a smoker you need to stand out at the front away from the door on a main road but it's safe enough as its busy, some top bunks are awkward as you need to go over the top of the barrier of the top bunk so would recommend you request a lower bunk. However none of the above would make me lower the rating, just points to note. 
Hope it helps.",7/1/2016,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"We had a great stay at the Green tortoise for 2 nights in a private room. Don't be put off by the comments about ""the long walk"" to the separate building for the private rooms, it's only two blocks away and isn't a hassle at all. When we checked in the lovely lady behind the desk walked us there so we knew where to go and told us the ins and outs of the area!

Free breakfast is always a plus anywhere you stay and they even have free dinner nights and other activities to join in if you're up for meeting people.

Thanks for a great stay!",7/1/2016,4,Couple
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I cannot say enough positive things about this hostel. My mom (74), my niece (16), and I (43) stayed here for four days in June as part of a three-week trip. I wanted my niece to experience a hostel for the first time, and this was the perfect choice. There were people of every age and background, and while we mostly kept to ourselves, there were plenty of opportunities to meet people. We stayed in a private room for three, and it was clean and comfortable. We did have some mosquitoes, but if it became a huge problem, we would have gotten spray.

The area was centrally located and felt safe even after midnight when I ventured out with my niece. There were some vagrants and the area does have strip clubs, but we never felt threatened. I might not have ventured out alone at that time of night, but that would be true almost anywhere.

The staff at the hotel was incredibly helpful at all hours of the morning and night. I'm giving a shout out to Nessa – she was friendly, informative, and patient. We loved her! Several staff members even helped us mail a very large package home by providing tape, sharpie, scissors, etc...

So, what made this hostel great? I've stayed in many hostels in Europe - some excellent, some awful, and some in-between. This one stood out for the following reasons: 

- They had directions to everything written out in advance on little sheets of paper in the lobby
-You could store food / share food / cook on your own at all hours in the kitchen.
- There were so many bathrooms in the hallway that you never had to wait - and they were kept impeccably clean.
- The staff was so happy to help everyone get to know the city.
- The hostel itself is beautiful – the woodwork in the dining room recalls an earlier, more glamorous age.

I am so glad we stayed here while in San Francisco. I can't imagine having stayed anywhere else.",6/1/2016,Family,

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"My experience at this hostel has always been great. Now I will say this, my ability to stay here being a Bay Area local is a major exception, so if you are local, don't expect it to happen for you as well.

I booked the same day I was going to stay (for one night). Tony, who was working desk at the time called me after my online booking was submitted (go through their website to get the better deal, do NOT use a third party as you get service fees) to let me know I could not stay (policy for most hostels). He later called me back before I booked a place else where and he said he made an effort to get me a room. THANK YOU!!! On arrival we were greeted with kindness and put into a room that was better than expected (I felt like we were upgraded, so thank you again). I was in town for the Bernie Rally at Crissy Field, which is why I stayed one night.

My stay was one night, and as expected it was a great time (This is the second time I've been lucky to stay at this place). The rooms are small, but they have several public shared spaces you can hang out, and there is a whole city of things to see! The ball room/dining room/kitchen area is open to socialize. There is a sitting space with computers. They have bikes to rent and usually something fun happening.

This is a no frills style place to stay, but it is cozy and welcoming. Yes the area around looks a little seedy, but in reality I've never experienced any issues (in the two times I've stayed, and other times I've been in the area).

Because this is a party hostel, be aware that the rooms above the ball room have a little sound bleed if they are playing music, or travelers are having a good time. You are welcome to have some drinks in the ball room. No food in your rooms at any time, no exceptions. There is a pizza place near by and a corner store to get snacks or drinks.

Laundry on site is $2 wash and $2 a dry. Several shared bathrooms on all floors. Doors lock at 8pm and you have to ring a bell to be let in (they are very responsive). Desk is open 24 hours a day. The team can answer any questions you have about how to get around the city, what sites you can see and how to get to them. There is bike rental 24 hours for $25 if you are up to it.

All in all, if I could stay here whenever I stay in SF I would, but with the restrictions of local people I consider myself SUPER lucky for the two times I've been here. I have always enjoyed my stay, the people I meet and the things I see. I tell all my out of town friends about this place. Keep being amazing GT Team!",6/1/2016,5,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights and had a blast. We found the place on AirBnB and got a room for a steal, considering San Fran prices.

The central room being an old ballroom with high ceilings was a great place to eat the free breakfast and 3x weekly free dinners. 

The place had a great vibe with staff being very helpful.

Only downside was the parking, but like any accommodation in a large downtown metropolitan area, try not to bring as car as cycling is the best form of transport.

Will definately stay again, whenever we return to San Fran.",6/1/2016,5,Couple

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"We stayed in a twin private room with bunkbed for 4 nights. Accommodation is San Fran is incredibly expensive, and this was the cheapest centrally located hostel we could find. Next time we would go for Air BnB, even if it means being a little less central. 

Pros
1. Location - inbetween Chinatown and Little Italy and well serviced by public transport. 
2. Breakfast/dinner inclusions - very generous breakfast included each morning (fruit, oatmeal, bagels, eggs) and dinners 3 times a wk. 
3. Resources - excellent resources near reception (brochures on things to do, directions on how to visit key tourist attractions) and reception willingness to help with anything from hiring a bike to airport shuttle. Also lots of activities offered from group dinners to pub crawls 
4. Large communal area- has a massive ballroom style communal area connected to the kitchen, and used for breakfast/dinners and open most of the time for people to sit in

Cons
1. Steep stairs, and lots of them - don't stay hear if you're not comfortable lugging luggage up and down
2. Cleanliness - place is very old. It is kept as clean as practicable, but really needs a full reno and refresh. Bunk beds rock when you climb up them to second level, sheets and towels are very old, bathrooms are quite grotty, and the whole place has a weird smell to it. General level of hygiene and cleanliness in kitchen needs improvement - whole cutlery set needs replacing, as does chairs and tables. 
3. Noise - we could hear the aircon from the adjacent pub when in our room. It is apparently turned on when sporting events are being shown on TV, and turned off around 9-10pm when the games finish. It was very noisy, and we complained to reception who were initially unresponsive and just gave us ear plugs. We complained again, and mgmt. was much more accommodating and transferred rooms for us. This was indicative of our experience with reception - the majority were delightful and very helpful (inc mgmt.) however this was overshadowed by a couple of unfriendly and curt people who clearly didn't give a stuff. One had music blring from her computer as we were trying to speak with her - very unprofessional.",5/1/2016,3,Family

The hostel is also right near CityLights Bookstore for literature fans. It is also surprisingly quiet for a large hostel. I enjoyed my stay - it was all very San-Fran.

The only reason I cannot give the Green Tortoise a 5/5 are the bathrooms.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"After a great stay in a dorm in 2012, we returned and tried out the private rooms which are in a separate building a couple of blocks away. The building is nice, with small but comfortable rooms and a good kitchen. 

However, the building is incredibly noisy. We slept with ear plugs in and still got repeatedly woken up. Our room was at the front between the metal gate on the front door which slammed shut on anytime someone went in or out, and the kitchen, with people watching movies on their laptop til the early hours. 
We stayed ten nights and left exhausted. We had specifically asked for a quiet room when booking as we were staying so long, and I appreciate that's not always possible, but think we got the loudest room possible next to the front gate. 

Another issue is the bathrooms. There are 3 bathrooms containing 2 showers for the building (I think ten bedrooms), but one of the showers had a broken handle which meant it was impossible to use without getting repeatedly blasted with freezing and then boiling water. Noone seemed bothered to fix it. There were also a lot of ants in the bathroom...

On the plus side, the hostel itself is a fabulous building and the staff are super friendly. The free evening meals 3 times a week are brilliant.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I checked in Friday November 13th. There are a bunch of good stuff I'll review about this hostel.
You can't beat the location and price, the hostel is located right on Broadway and Kearny, it is within walking distance to bars, restaurants, it is within walking distance to Chinatown, and I mean; that is a huge avenue of Chinese businesses and stuff, very cool, it is located in a very very safe area. You can also walk to the piers from there. Transportation is very easy to find, I wasn't driving so I didn't have a problem at all moving around. The hostel staff is super nice and very attentive, they answered all my questions and were definitely knowledgeable. WIFI is complimentary, the also have computer available in case that you need to browse the internet. I called the hostel that same Friday and spoke to Fiona, she was very attentive and very nice over the phone and as well as in person, which of course made me feel I was going to the right place since the beginning. Dan, Fiona, Ness?, Ben, (and I can't remember the other gal) super super nice people. The building has no elevators, so if you're carrying a lot of luggage keep in mind you gotta go upstairs to get to the lobby. The hostel is (in general) kept very clean and neat, they offer dorms and private rooms. I was in a dorm, a 3 bed bunk, super nice individuals from all over the world. The bed bunks have lockers at the bottom where you can keep your stuff locked, the front desk sells the locks for $5, or you can bring your own. I was in the 3rd floor. Very quite, the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is shared, in my floor there were 5 bathrooms I think, I had no problem at all with that. They don't offer towels complimentary; you either bring yours or rent them at the front desk for $1. The hostel also has a huge ""hang out"" area located in the lobby that has tables and chairs, that's where the kitchen is located as well, they have a bunch of cooking pots, cooking utensils, everything that you'd need to prepare your own food, believe me; that was so convenience. There're grocery stores near by, wholefoods, safeway. This lobby area also have a pool table, and of course it is free, for you to get the balls and the poles you'd need to see the front desk because they hold your key while you're playing. This area also have a Foosball table, what a fun time! The hostel offers complimentary breakfast in the morning for free, don't expect anything fancy tho, the 3 nights I was there the served bagels, marmalade, butter, cream cheese, fruits, coffee, oatmeal, coffee, eggs; however with the eggs you gotta prepare them yourself. The kitchen area also have those commercial fridges where you can safely keep your food. One of the nights I was there they had live music playing, it was a great experience. There's a bar downstairs and they do something called ""beer pong championship"" or something like that haha; very nice activity to do and meet new people, I was traveling solo and ended up making very good friends. Overall, would I stay here again? YESSSSSSS, would I recommend the hostel to other people? YESSSSSSSSS, I made a lot of research before booking, and all the reviews I saw about other hostels in SFO were terrible, this hostel had amazing reviews, and now I can tell why, I think it was the greatest choice to stay there. Book with them directly and you'll get the best price. I will definitely stay here next time I come back.",11/1/2015,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Great location next to Chinatown, and you can walk to the pier. Comfortable beds, nice breakfast, great people, great atmosphere!

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Stayed here with another girl in late October in one of the private rooms as we weren't too sure about dorm rooms. The private rooms were in another building a couple of streets away and had a balcony with a beautiful view of bay bridge and the financial district. Honestly feel like we couldn't have picked a better place location wise - although it is near the red light district I felt very safe here and it's very well connected to get a taxi/bus or even walk to other areas easily. The hostel itself was great, clean and full of friendly & VERY helpful staff who offer no end of advice and suggestions. Breakfast is included which consists of bagels, fruit and eggs which you make yourself. Really wish we had stayed in the dorm rooms as they seemed more social but the hostel gives you plenty of opportunities to socialise with people through their daily events. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to San Francisco - thanks for a lovely stay :) 

Ps, I would suggest using the shuttle bus company they work with to get you there from the airport as it's only 10 dollars (without tip) and really convenient. Can't remember the name now but we found details on their website and just phoned the company when we got to SFO - dead easy:)",10/1/2015,5,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"The decor of Green Tortoise is striking, the colourful carpets, and huge common area.

The staff are friendly and helpful, probably the friendliest staff I have ever found at a hostel. The breakfasts are good - bagels/Toast/Cereal/eggs/fruit. There are free dinners three times a week - I only had one while I was there a vegetable curry and it was good. 

I stayed in a four bedroom female dorm. It was a decent size with plenty of storage under each bed and each bed had it's own light and electrical outlet. wifi was free and fast.

The only issue is that sometimes the bathrooms are all in use - around 9am... maybe choose when you have your showers. 

The location is great - plenty of character!",10/1/2015,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"This hostel had me from the moment I walked in! It is so hip and fun with quirky decor and super friendly staff. My room was fantastic! I stayed in a private room and it was quiet, and had a mirror and lots of power points. My bed was big and really comfortable! 
The bathrooms were a wonderful surprise for me- they are not ""dorm"" style bathrooms. Each floor has five INDIVIDUAL bathrooms with a shower, toilet, sink, and mirror! 
The location is fantastic! Set in the heart of Little Italy, it is quaint during the day, and lively at night. There are lots of strip clubs around, so I was a little concerned at the beginning. But I felt so safe even late at night because the streets were busy and well lit. 
Free Breakfast and wifi- all in all a great stay! Remember to bring earplugs!",10/1/2015,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Maybe I just lucked out and had the time of my life because my fellow travelers were an exceptional bunch, but I imagine my experience was not exceptional, and the staff is extraordinary.

Special shout out to Hillary, Michael, and all the German pool sharks.

We were able to stay in a room together (for five people) and our friends where close by. The staff was very helpful; had maps on hand and gave us every detail we needed to know.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"This hostel is well located of you are a newby to the city. Walking distance to many attractions, bars, rest. The staff at reception very helpful. Breakfast is pretty decent considering that is free. Large variation of food. Even eggs that you have to cook yourself but it's cool.

The staff at kitchen are kind of strict and it seems that they are really telling you off when you do something wrong but it's funny as they were not native English speakers(Italian, Chinese).

Room nothing special but again you are staying in a hostel you can't expect the Ritz Carlton",10/1/2015,5,Solo

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"There are limited choices for hostels in San Fran. This one is the place to be as far as I'm aware. It's the one that's most people seem to talk about and it satisfies all the criteria that you want from a hostel, cleanliness, social, fair value, good location. It doesn't excel at any of these either in my opinion but it does that all quite well.",9/1/2015,4,Couple
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"Around the clock friendly staff, well organized, playful atmosphere; with lots for its guests to do. 

The sort of place where they've already thought of everything you need. Definitely look forward to my next stay there.

They also offer group adventure trips in their traveling hostel RV!",10/1/2015,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I am not in my 20s. I am not in my 30s. For me to stay at the Green Tortise Hostel was a bit odd to my friends. However, I'm so glad I did this for my birthday! This is a great, fun, quirky, older place to stay right in San Francisco.

It offers free breakfast every day - you cook your own eggs and clean your own dishes. They also have free dinner several nights a week. You are invited to help cook, but you can just come eat if you prefer.

The huge meeting room has plenty of places to sit, and there's also a pool table. I saw something about laundry facilities and a dry sauna. The main ballroom area had music and lights going with a lot of active younger people when I got back to the hotel at night. However, I went up the stairs to my private room and heard nothing.

The rooms are just fine. Mine even had a box fan. Any house rules are clearly marked and explained by the very friendly staff. I don't think there was air conditioning, but I just opened my window at night. There was a nice cool breeze. There's also free Wi-Fi.

There were a lot of signs concerning trips, excursions, and such. I didn't participate in them, but I'm sure they would be fun for the younger ones. The check-in desk has free maps of the local area if you want one.

This was a great place for me to stay and stretch myself. There are a few places nice girls don't visit close by, but no one ever bothered me, even though I walked from AT & T Park by myself about 10:30 at night. It also helps to make you feel safe, because only guests with keys are allowed to enter the hotel. No ""extras"" or guests.

The bathrooms are shared, but you get private use while you are in each one. There are many of them, too. Every one I visited was clean all the time. They even provide soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Towels can be rented for only $1. They also have free day storage for your bags when you check out.

I really don't have anything negative to say about this place. I would recommend this hostel as a great adventure if you are up for it.",9/1/2015,5,Solo
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I had never stayed at a hostel prior to my stay at the Green Tortoise so I was slightly nervous when my friend suggested it, however I would stay again in a heart beat. My friend and I stayed in a room with 3 other people for the 2 nights that we were in town. The front desk staff was very helpful with recommendations about bike rentals and events happening that weekend. The room had 2 sets of twin bunk beds and I got a stand alone bed on the window. There were huge storage spaces under the beds so we had plenty of room for our luggage. I would recommend bringing flip flops for the shower. I never had to wait to use the shower. They have free breakfast in the morning that consists of assorted bagels and fruit. You wash the dishes that you use and they have a common fridge that you can use to store any of your food. They also have wifi and common area computers available to all guests. They also have 2 massage chairs downstairs that were awesome!",10/1/2014,4,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"We picked Green Tortoise based on the reviews here (which weren't wrong) and the fact that this hostel seems to be one of the cheapest in San Fran (which isn't cheap at all). 
It's in a convenient area, close to the waterfront and easy enough to walk to Union Square too. Lots of bus routes etc around too. The area felt safe enough, though I think it can be quite a party area with plenty of clubs etc around. We didn't notice noise.
The hostel itself provides so much! Free wifi, breakfast, some dinners, toiletries & a sauna (!), various cheap events to get to know others. A good place to stay as a group or if you were travelling alone and wanted to meet people. They'll help organise transfers, and have connections with travel and bike companies.
Our room was comfortable and safe. It was up the road from the actual hostel which we weren't expecting (we had a private room) but wasn't toooo much of a hassle. I'm not sure what the dorms are like, but the kitchen and bathroom at our area were clean and well equipped.",9/1/2015,5,Couple

They also offer so many extras like shampoo and conditioner in the showers, free breakfast daily and dinner a few nights a week, and a very convenient computer bank where I could set up the rest of my trip.

My friend and I went for a shared room - there were 6 beds in all and our experience of that was mostly good (though that depends on the travellers in with you). 

A handy tip would be to pick an unpopular time to shower - maybe in the evening or in the day so you can avoid queues. Once we figured out a strategy we were never delayed.

All in all, it was brilliant. They also advertised local activities like free walking tours etc to help keep you busy.",7/1/2014,5,Friends

The staff was extremely serviceminded, breakfast really decent minding the price you pay for the room. We stayed in the doubleroom-house one block down the street and that house has a gloruius little balcony with an amazing view - for free!

Staff was very nice and helpful, they always have answers to any question of their guests.

Private rooms (where I stayed) are in separate building a block from main building where breakfast is. There are 2 rooms on ground floor but right next to main door, kitchen and bathroom so can hear everything. 3 rooms downstairs are right in front of washing machine and dryer so again very noisy (they do have policy that prohibits use after 10:30pm). Only the 3 or 4 rooms upstairs are relatively quieter. 

Toilet and shower was combined in one room. There's one on each floor but you had to walk on an outdoor staircase to go to another bathroom if the one on your floor was occupied. The light often didn't work and it smelled.

My stay in USA Hotels was much better, both room wise, bathroom and the overall layout. Would definitely recommend it over Green Tortoise",12/1/2014,1,Solo

I've always felt safe at the hostel and in the neighborhood, the staff is very friendly and answers all your questions. The common room is something quite special to behold, an old ballroom is the best place to meet travelers from around the world. Their kitchen is quite large and fully equipped, the breakfast service offers fresh fruit, oatmeal, eggs and bagels. Their free dinner once or twice a week is worth it as well. Wifi all through out the hostel (thank god). I've stayed in 2 different types of rooms, a 5 person coed dorm facing the main road, which was quite loud so if you want something a bit more quiet ask for something facing the courtyard or the ""wall"". The 4 person coed dorm was a bit stuffy, we were facing the courtyard, however it was quiet. The bedding was CLEAN, very important to me. The washrooms were clean and the psychedelic carpet looked clean as well... They could use a new massage chair and some central air but after some of the nightmares I've stayed in, this is a beautifully magical and wonderful hostel... They have events every night, tours during the day and lots of swanky n' trashy bars in the area.",12/1/2014,4,Friends
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I Recently stayed here and I want to leave an honest review:

1) The first thing I noticed when entering the hostel was a bad smell - stale horrible
2) The staff were helpful
3) Stayed in a private room in the seperate block it was noisy with a homeless person sleeping just across from the entrance.
4) The room was not the cleanest and the bed sheets felt damp
5) Was woken up every night by other guests staying in the block
6) The breakfast was proberly the best thing about this place although it is all self service and you clean up after your self and wash your own stuff up after cooking.
7) The guests that stay here are mainly young travellers.

I would not stay here again but if you are looking for a cheapish place in the centre of San Fran and are not bothered by the above you will be happy with it.",12/1/2014,2,Couple
Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"I loved this place and wish I could have stayed longer. The staff were really friendly and can answer all your questions.

The free dinners several times a week are insane, massive buffet! There was one night where we had Mexican it was fantastic. The hostel itself has a really social atmosphere. The massive common room/dining room is great to meet people especially during dinner time/breakfast- also free! (bagels etc)

I was staying in a mixed dorm, and had an awesome bed by the window. I like how they put big lockers under the beds and include a sink in the room so you can brush your teeth etc. There are plenty of showers/toilets, never had to wait. 

The area around the hostel is hilarious, there are a few strip bars but also some great restaurants and pubs. The 'Saloon' and 'Vesuvio' are nice busy places to go for drinks. The hostel also organised dinners and some nightlife stuff so it's fine if you're on your own. I also hired a bike off a place recommended by the hostel, they gave me a discount and I got to store the bike in the hostel overnight.

If you are a backpacker or want somewhere social and fun this is a great place. It is pretty much a party hostel but they do stop the noise around midnight so I never had any problems sleeping. I do remember seeing a guy going up to the desk and complaining about noise at night, he was staying there with his family. I've never really understood why anyone goes to a hostel expecting peace and quiet, especially one advertised as social- go to a hotel or a hostel that is more appropriate.

Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco,,"We stayed for five nights at the Green Tortoise in a private room. The location is fabulous- next to Columbus Avenue and a short walk to the Embarcadero and Market Street. There are great bars and coffee shops in the adjacent streets.

The room wasn't actually in the hostel itself but slightly farther down the street in a self-contained house with a shared bathroom and kitchen. It had a balcony with views of the TransAmerica Pyramid and the Oakland Bridge. It was cleaned daily.

The only downside was a lack of parking, which is difficult and expensive to find in San Francisco. The hostel is such good value that the cost of this is easily offset by the savings made on the room.",11/1/2014,4,Couple
